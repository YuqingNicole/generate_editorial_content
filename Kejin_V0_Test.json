Th e field of archa eology is concerned with the study of past hum an so cieties based primarily on the material culture produced and used by people.  For more than a century, archaeologists have been developing and refining a suite of meth ods for recovering and  analyzing mater ial cultural remains that have been  deposited into the archaeological record.  These material remains  (artifacts, ecofacts, features, sites, etc. ) often comprise a rather fragmentary, but nonetheless complex data base.  This course explores  how archaeologi sts employ these material remains t o construct  interpretations about past societies.  Lecture topics will include discussions on the formation of the archaeological record; the histo ry of archaeology; developing research design s; field meth ods (survey and excavation) for recovering and reco rding archa eolog ical data; laboratory methods employed in the analysis of archaeological data; chronology; and generating interpretations about the past. One of the them es that will be addressed through out this  course is the concept of “excluded pasts ,” that is traditional histories written by the dominant culture that are often exclusionary in their accounts of ancient and recent peoples.  Mainstream histories often exclude or presen t in a biased or dis torted manner ac counts of common or lower status fa milies, mem bers of minority groups, or individuals persecuted for religious, political or sexual persuasions.  Until recently, archaeologists have tended to ignore most descendant commu nities in their rese arch. Consequen tly, s ensitive cultural materials w ere sometim es appropriated and placed in museums and curation facilities.  As will be discussed in class, Native American scholars refer to this kind of archaeology as “scientific colon ialism” or “imperial  archaeology. ”  As a consequence of a growing backl ash to thes e pas t practices, in combination with recent legislation involving the repatriation of material culture back to descendant communities, the field of archaeology is currently undergoing significa nt changes in it s methods and practices as it attem pts to beco me a more inclusive and collaborative science.  The course will explore how archaeologists today are creating close working relationships with diverse stakeholders, participa ting in collaborativ e research teams , and undertaking educational outre ach with th e pub lic. Anthro 2AC will highlight an important g oal of contemporary archaeology:  the construction of alternative, pluralistic histories using multiple lines of evidence.  Course lectures 2 and readings will c onsider how archaeology can provide  a powerful  meth odology for constructing alternative histories of excluded peoples (and their encounters with dominant cultures) by examining the material culture of their daily practic es.  As we will see,  the performance  of daily routines produces pattern ed accumula tions  of material culture that are among the most interpretable kinds of deposits found in archaeological contexts.  While most people may perceive these kinds of deposits as  simply garbage or r efuse collection s, when analyzed by archaeologists they can pr ovide  critical insights about past people.  The course examines how the archaeology of daily practice, when integrated with other sources of relevant information (oral tradit ions, oral histories , written record s), provides the most powerful way to understa nd th e past outside of a time machine. The course will present case studies from California to highlight the potential of writing alternative histories about people with e xcluded pasts.  The case studies wil l also highlight the benefits and c hallenges o f wor king with diverse stakeholders  and descendant communities in contemporary California.  Case studies will focus on the archaeology of Native Californian s (e.g., the Kasha ya Pomo , Coast Miwok , Amah Mutsun Tribal Band ), Hispanic  and Euro -Ame rican colonia l settlements,  and recent Hippie  commune s (late 1960s) . PREREQUISITES:   None COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Three exams required (tw o midterms and a final exam) and a short research paper (3 -5 pages , typed, double space).  The format of the final an d midterm exams is a combination of multiple choice, identif ication, and essay questions.  Participation in weekly discussion sections is mandatory.  Each student is responsible for signing up for a discus sion section lis ted in the Schedule of Classes .  The final grade wi ll be based on participation in the discussion section (20%), the two midterm exams (20% each), the final exam (30%), and s hort research paper (10%).  The purpose of the research paper is t o have students select an archaeological site or place in the great er San Francisco Bay Area or somewhere in California (or outside California if appro ved by your GSI) that will be the focus of archival/library research.  Students will id entify reports and publications wr itten about the site, read a sam ple of the avail able literature, visit the site (if  possible), and write up their observations in a 3 -5 page paper (due in the last GSI section of the semester).  If you are late turning in y our research paper then you will b e docked significant points for every day it is late. DISCUSSION SECTIONS: Student s must sign up f or a discussion section or risk being dropped from the course. Discussion sections are an important component of the course  and you are expected  to attend them.  Discussion section assignme nts must be turn ed in on time to receive  full credi t.  You will be docked points for every day your GSI assignments are late.  Remember that performance in the discussion sections will count  for 20% of your final grade. SPECIAL NOTE: Please note that no m ake-up exams wil l be given in this class .  Please t ake a look at th e exam dates and plan your schedule for the semester so that you will be here for each exam (that is, do not  buy an airline ticket to go home until after the  final exam).  If you have a leg itimate 3 schedulin g problem, then please bring it to  the attention of  your Graduate Student Instructor or instructor within the first two weeks of class so that arrangements can be made ahead of time for you.  A very, very ra re exception to the “no make -up exam” policy may be made if arrangements are made prior to the exam and a valid doctor ’s note excusing you from the exam is presented to the instructor.  Also note that questions about the gr ading of exams can be brought to the attention of your Graduate S tudent Instructor  only within one week after the ex am has been hande d back to you.  In other words, you have one week to look over the exam to make sure that it is correctly graded.  After th e week is over, no changes will b e made in the point scores for a ny exams.

This course enables students to define their own personal code of ethics, practice strategies for tackling ethical problems, and develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be a responsible scientist and engineer. Highlights of  current and historical dilemmas in various topic areas include: data misrepresentation, intellectual property, ownership of human material, privacy and access to data, medical technologies, genetic modification, and environmental issues.   Instructor and student led case studies, prepared debates, and classroom discussions will serve as vehicles for interactive learning. Course Goals: • Students will define and refine their own personal code of ethics . • Students will learn and implement a practical approach to understanding ethical dilemmas. • Students will develop an understanding of current and historical ethical issues in science and engineering through case studies, debates, and discussion. Student Learning Objectives Students w ill gain an understanding of  and develop/practice/apply : • Practical a pproaches to ethical dilemmas • Major ethical theories • Major considerations for ethical dilemmas in various topics • Their own personal code of ethics • How to prepare and present a debate or roundtable discussion • How to work effectively in teams • Peer evaluation Grading Scheme COURSE COMPONENT  % OF GRADE Participation Attendance  10% Weekly reflections  20% Peer reviews  5% Code of Ethics Personal code of ethics (2 drafts, 1 final)  15% Peer review  5% Debates Prepare and deliver topic  20% Peer review  5% Exam Final exam  20% TOTAL  100% Because this is an ethics course and opinions may differ on various topics, grading will be based on thoughtful and thorough completion of assignments and never graded on the ‘right’ opinion or approach to a problem.

A handout will be available on-line concerning each exam – room assignments, material covered, etc.   There is NO additional final exam for1AL. 13. Assignments, exams:  When papers, etc. are returned it is your responsibility to pick them up.  If you do not attend discussion, then you must contact your GSI and get the papers from them, at their convenience.  Papers not picked up after 3 weeks may be discarded.  LECTURE MATERIALS: Textbook: Campbell Biology, 11th edition ONLY including Mastering Biology.  You will need the 11th edition and the electronic resources for the graded assignments.  The 10th edition will not work for Mastering Biology. Learning Catalytics (LC)  – Each question is worth ½ pt for participation and an additional ½ pt for the correct answer.  You can earn up to a MAXIMUM of 12 points per lecturer.  There will typically be at least 16 points possible for each part.  You will also need the Learning Catalytics account for Bio 1AL (6 pts per lecture).  You must submit your SID once you set up a LC account for BOTH Bio 1A and Bio 1AL.  The session ID to enter your UCB SID for Bio 1A is 26751386.  The session ID to enter your UCB SID for Bio 1AL (Lab) is 99440234  Course Reader(s):  The course reader for the first part of the course will be posted on bCourses and available at Replica Copy, 2140 Oxford.  There will be a reader for part two.  There will NOT be a reader for part three, instead lectures will be posted on bCourses at 24 hours before lecture. Exam Reader:  A reader with previous exams is available at Replica Copy (and on bCourses).    GRADING PROCEDURE:   Grades will be determined numerically as follows: Learning Catalytics (lecture questions) Points (3 X 12)   36 pt’s. Mastering Biology (3 X 24)  72 pt’s. Midterm Examinations (2 x 100)  200 pt’s. Final (67 for Dr. Doudna, 67 for Dr. Fischer,  166 for Dr. Feller  300 pt’s.  Total: 608 pt’s. Page 3 of 6 Changes affecting the point distribution, the reading schedule, or other aspects of the syllabus may occur during the semester.  We will inform you of any changes.  Letter grades are based upon the points that you EARN (not based upon needs or wants).  They are guaranteed as follows. A (some form of an A) 100-90% D (some form of a D) 69-60% B (some form of a B) 89-80% F 59-00% C (some form of a C) 79-70%    However, in the event that some examinations have been unusually difficult, the cut offs for letter grades may be lowered (but only by a few percentage points, and as deemed necessary).  Historically around 40-50% of the class EARN A’s and B’s.  The grade distribution is set by the Department of Molecular Cell Biology. If necessary the class will be curved to match the distribution set by the department (which is followed each semester).   Electronic Assignments.   Mastering Biology.  The url for the online homework system is SPRING2020  You will need to have a “Purchase Code” which is available in the book purchased from Cal Student Store or The Student Store.  A distribution of student scores in Mastering Biology will be generated and a grade scale from 0 to 26 points will be assigned.  The maximum possible number of points will be 24.  Thus if you have 18.5/26 of the total points you will get 18.5 points.  If you had 25.2/26 of the total points you will get 24 points (the maximum).  Thus it is possible for you to miss one or two assignments and still end up with the maximum.  Each assignment is typically due by 8 AM of the start of the next lecture.   Extensions may be made as deemed necessary but the extension will be for the entire class, not just a few individuals.  No extensions of deadlines.  Each professor has their own set of Mastering Biology assignments but all will be available on the one course (UCBBIOLOGY1ASPRING2020).   A specific handout will be posted on bCourses how the points will be distributed for Mastering Biology.    I  GRADES:  In keeping with University regulations, the grade of \"incomplete\" is assigned to a student only if (1) the student has completed at least one-half of the material with a passing grade of C or better and (2) the student presents documented medical evidence of inability to complete the course on schedule.  The student assigned an I grade in Biology 1A must complete the work before the first day of classes in the Spring Semester of 2021, without including the course for units on the study list, or the I lapses to an F. CHEATING:  The rare student found cheating in the course will be reported to the University for review for dismissal.  An automatic 0 will be given on that assignment.  Cheating is not tolerated.  This includes ALL work—including pre-labs! RECOMMENDATIONS:  It is probably better for you to obtain letters from upper division classes, in the future, but we are willing to write letters.  Your GSI will write an initial draft of the letter (they know you the best).  This letter will be modified by a faculty member or the course coordinator.  HOW TO DO WELL 1. Come to lectures and take notes.  Make sure you review them. 2. Keep up with the material.  It is essential that you do not fall behind.  Seek help if needed. 3. Clarify topics you do not understand by a. Coming to faculty office hours and ask questions.   b. Coming to GSI office hours and ask questions. c. Getting into a study group. d. Reading the book. Page 4 of 6 e. Using email to ask the faculty questions. 4. Use the exam reader, making sure you understand the reasoning behind the answers. 5. Come to the exam review sessions and ask questions. 6. Come to discussion with questions.  Faculty evaluations.  Your input is important and valuable.  Ten minutes of each faculty’s last lecture will be set aside for you to complete the evaluations.  1. Dr. Doudna 2/09-23 for evaluations.  10 minutes will be provided on 9/27 for evaluations. 2. Dr. Fischer 3/22- 4/5 for evaluations.  10 minutes will be provided on 11/1 for evaluations. 3. Dr. Feller 4/26—5/10 for evaluations.  10 minutes will be provided on 12/6 for evaluations.  BIOLOGY 1A STUDY RESOURCES   The following is a partial list.  Please take advantage of these resources.  Additional opportunities such as faculty & graduate student reviews may also occur during the semester.  Further information is available in the lab manual and in the exam reader. Faculty Office Hr’s:  Office hours are typically held in 2084 VLSB.  Faculty will announce office hours and any changes to them.   Academic Coordinator Office Hr’s (2088 VLSB): Refer to bCourses for up to date hours. Graduate Student Instructors Office Hr’s (2084 VLSB): Refer to bCourses for up to date hours. Student Learning Center (SLC, 189 Chavez Student Center):  The SLC offers student-led study groups and tutoring.  Study groups require registration which can be done on SLC's webpage (slc.berkeley.edu ).  Tutoring is generally available MTWTh 9-4 and F 9-12.  See the SLC's webpage for more information.  Note:  None of the SLC's services are a substitute for lecture, discussion, reading the text, or attending Bio 1A office hours.  However, they are an excellent way to get additional assistance and feedback from trained undergraduate tutors who want to assist you in meeting your academic goals.  STUDY GROUPS:  These are a great way to learn the material.  I encourage you to form study groups, either within your lab or with other students.  Tutor Services (fee):  Formal tutoring (variable fees) from individuals may be available as the semester progresses.  Contact Mike.  Safe, Supportive, and Inclusive Environment  Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or GSI is responsible for the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a romantic or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process. Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this policy, you may contact the Confidential Care Advocates on campus for support related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be made by calling (510) 642-1988. The classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments for everyone. The Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) is responsible for ensuring the University provides an environment for faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

ISBN-13: 978-1108421478  Course Description:  ChemEng 40 introduces process design and analysis. The theme is chemical engineers design and analyze processes in which physical and chemical changes yield useful products. Although most chemical processes are sophisticated, they have simple beginnings; designs evolve by adding to and modifying simple ideas. At the end of the semester you will have the tools to design an entire process, analyze the process, and evaluate it from an economic perspective. Though the problems we will encounter encompass a broad range of subfields of chemical engineering, we will use a common approach.   Homework:  Assigned on Tuesdays and due online on Monday night at 11:00 pm as one file uploaded to bCourses Assignment. Late homework is subject to a 30% per day penalty, defined as 30% penalty for assignments up to 24 hours late, 60% penalty for assignments between 24 and 48 hours late, 90% penalty for assignments between 48 and 72 hours late.   Grading:    Homework     20%  Discussion, Participation, and Quizzes 20% Midterm      20%  Final Project     20% Final Exam      20% Chemical Engineering 40 Introduction to Chemical Engineering Design  Spring 2020 Syllabus  Questions: Please post your questions about homework and course content on the piazza discussion board (Class Link: piazza.com/berkeley/spring2020/cbe40/home) so that all members of the class can benefit from the response.  Questions will be answered on weekday evenings.  Please do not send e-mails regarding homework or other course materials as these cannot be answered in a timely fashion.  Instead, consult an instructor or GSI during office hours.   Piazza Discussion Board Guidelines: This is a platform for discussing course material and logistics for Chemical Engineering 40 course at UC Berkeley, and related matters such as the chemical engineering discipline and careers. The choice to host a forum-based communication platform is for value-added discussions and the opportunity to answer questions in a way that can be shared among the community. It also creates an organized and searchable database of questions and answers.  To make this forum the best it can be:  Please be respectful of your peers and others in your posts. The boards will be regularly monitored to maintain this community standard.  If you have information or resources to share, you can respond to polls and discussions, either publicly or privately, either anonymously or identified. The instructor will endorse good answers.  Remember that people learn how to do engineering analysis and design through repeated practice, and that some confusion or struggle along the way is normal and necessary for lasting learning.  Please respect the learning process for all involved, specifically by refraining from giving the answer outright. Numerical stops along the way to the final answer are also discouraged. Please keep your discussion about things like:  Clarifying the language or nature of the question Pointing to helpful resources (such as material properties tables) Giving a helpful \"hint\" to point others in the right direction for the solution approach  Please link to other relevant posts with the @ function (@73 to link to the 73rd post).\t  Expectations of Academic Integrity and Ethics We are privileged to participate in the pursuit of knowledge and truth in higher education at UC Berkeley, and students and instructors are expected to maintain academic integrity and an environment of respect for the course of study and one another at all times.  Our class is a safe space for people diverse in traits and ideology to exchange ideas and grow in experience and knowledge. Direct any concerns about classroom environment immediately to the instructor.  The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:  “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”  The instructors expect that you will adhere to this code.    Cheating:  A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating.  Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will be reported.  In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of Chemical Engineering 40 Introduction to Chemical Engineering Design  Spring 2020 Syllabus cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.    Plagiarism:  Any item submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own original work.  You may use words, image, or ideas of other individuals from publications, web sites, or other sources, but only with proper attribution. “Proper attribution” means that you have fully identified the original source and the extent of your use of the words or ideas of others that you reproduce.  To copy text or ideas without proper attribution is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment.  See the library webpage for additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it.  Accommodation of Special Situations and Needs If you need accommodations related to physical, psychological, or learning abilities, please speak to the instructor after class or during office hours.   If you must miss class because of religious observation, holy day, student-athlete or student-performer commitment, or off-site interview please inform the instructor in writing by the end of the second week of the term, or as soon as possible, in order to make arrangements to submit work early or reschedule an exam.  It is your responsibility to review materials outside of class on your own to make up for class time missed.    Below are links to important University policies and resources. 1.

The afternoon section will be a repeat of the morning section. General Information: Chemistry 1A is a one  semester course that survey s the fundamentals of general chemistry. The learning goals of this course are to familiarize the students with the basic chemical concepts that are present in their lives. There will b e a stronger focus on concepts than on pure mathematical problem solving. Most questions will have an explanation component as well as mathematical component to reinforce an understanding of chemical concepts as well as quantitative skills . The course mate rial is quite diverse and difficult to unify with a cohesive story, therefore there are four separate units. The first unit will have periodic trends as the fundamentals of bonding. The second unit will cover matter and equilibrium with a focus on acid and  base reactions. In the third unit, we will learn about the different ways we categorize energy in chemistry. Finally, the fourth unit will introduce the class to light and how we use it to study differe nt properties of chemicals, including a review on wha t we know about bonding and molecular shapes . Course Website: http://bcourses.berkeley.edu The course website will be used for announcements throughout the semester, as well as for periodically posting selected resources. Homework sets will be posted regularly along with their keys, pictures of the lecture notes from class, links to the webcast,  as well as other resources for your convenience. You are responsible for checking the site on a regular basis.  Exam and quiz grades will  be posted under the Gradebook, but will also be available at http://gradescope.c om. Email: petermarsden@berkeley.edu All e-mail concerning Chemistry 1A should have “Chem 1A” in the title. Use e -mail for asking simple questions about the course or if you would like t o make an appointment to see me . Be aware that I will hold a total of  six office hours each week, so I may not be able to answer longer questions via email, nor will it be likely to have a long one -on-one meeting with me on a recurring schedule. Recommended Materials:  Tro, Chemistry: A  Molecular  Approach 3rd edition. (recommended, not required) (I suggest finding a used copy on amazon or a digital copy as those are cost effective options) Exams  (150 pt per midterm, 225 pt final, Total 675 pts) :  Exam  #1 will be held on Tuesday , February 12 (8-10 pm)  Exam #2 will be held on Tuesday, March 12 (7-9 pm)  Exam #3 will be held on Tuesday, April 16 (7-9 pm)  The Final Exam  will be held on Wednes day, May 15 (8:00 am – 11:00  am) Page 2 of 5 Homework: Homework sets will be posted regularly on the course website. The homework will not be graded, but is extremely important for understanding the material. Each set may contain suggested book problems from the 3rd edition of the Tro  text as well as problems that I have written. Due to the fast pace of this course, it will be easy to get behind. To ensure that this does not happen, I suggest you use the text problems as a “warm -up”. If you feel comfortable with the material, skip them  entirely. If you are struggling, be sure to go through them so that you will have a set of problem solving skills to apply to the more difficu lt problems on my homework sets. When attempting my homework sets, be sure to go through your notes at the same time. Many of the strategies outlined during lecture are directly applicable to the completion of the homework questions. Quizzes  (100 points total , best 10 scores of 1 4 quizzes ): Every Friday, there will be a n 8 minute, 1 0 point quiz administered during the lecture. You MUST  attend the lecture you are registered for in order to receive credit for your quiz. The quizzes will be pulled directly from the homework assignments for the first half of the course, and will be closel y related to the homework problems for the second half of the course. The best 10 quizzes of the total 14 will be included in your final score for the course. Because of this, there will be no make -up quizzes . Lecture attendance : General  chemistry is a concentrated and fast -moving subject. I hope to give you a different angle on general chemistry than you may have seen in high school. If you have not taken chemistry in a while, this course will still be approachable . I will be using the c halkboard as my main source of conveying information, therefore it is imperative that you attend lecture and diligently take notes and participate. Lecture attendance is particularly important, since all exams in this course will be based on the material covered in lecture. The textbook should be used as a supplement to the lectures. There may be many topics covered in lectures that are not in the text and you will be responsible for knowing this material. Discussions ( 150 Points , best 30 scores of 40 assignments ): Each week, you must attend your discussion section. During the hour, you will be with your graduate student instructor, solving problems associated with the previous 3 lectures. To be prepared for these discussions, go to lecture each week and  briefly review the material before attending your section. At the beginning of the semester, and again after each exam, there will be a lag on how many lectures will be covered during discussion ; this is okay and we have planned for it. Your discussion ha ndouts will be collected after each session, scanned, and graded. You will receive a link to your worksheets by the end of the day following your discussion. The discussions will be graded partially for completion, and partially for correctness. The rubric s will take into account the length of the given worksheets and will scale appropriately. Trust me, I want you to receive the vast majority of these points. Each worksheet  will be worth 5 points, with the best 30 scores counting toward your final grade for a total of 1 50 points. Page 3 of 5 Grading: The course will be graded on the basis of 925 points, distributed as follows:  10 best of 1 4 quizzes (10 points each for 100 total points)  30 best discussions of 40 assignments ( 5 points each for 1 50 total points)  Each exam is worth 1 50 points  (total of 450 points) .  The final exam will be worth 225 points. The final exam percentage can be used to replace the lowest exam percentage. Course Grade Final letter grades in this course will be based on the total points in the course.  Plusses and minuses will also be assigned.  Percentage cutoffs are approximately  (I reserve the right to lower these cutoffs if needed. This helps you ) : A+/A/A - (100% -90%); B+/B/B - (89% -71%); C+/C/C - (70% -55%); F (< 54%) Office Hours: Dr. Pete Marsden :  Tuesdays  from 9:00 am-11:00 am in 425 Latimer  Thursdays  from 3:00 pm-5:00 pm in 100E Hildebrand (Chem Library)  Email – You can set up meetings with me vi a email. Be sure to have “Chem 1A” as part of  the subject of the email  (petermarsden@berkeley.edu) . Graduate Student Instructors : Bixby North  (schedule will be posted on b Courses ) The GSI office hours are spread out th roughout the week, and are available on a walk-in basis to all enrolled students in both Chem 1A and Chem 1AL (lab). You may visit any GSI  (not just your discussion GSI)  during scheduled office hours. This is a very valuable resource and you are highly enco uraged to bring questions here on a regular basis.  Access to the room can be found on the north west face of Latimer Hall , across from the top exit of Pimentel . Weekly Review ( Tuesdays 7-9 pm in 1  Pimentel ): Our head GSI, Audrey Reeves  (areeves @berkeley.edu) , will be holding a 2 hour review each week on Tuesday night in 1 Pimentel  from 7pm to 9pm. She will cover concepts from the previous lectures and provide a slightly different take on the material as well as some more practice problems. I rec ommend attending those reviews; Audrey has a great grasp on the material and is extremely approachable.

Taking UC Berkeley as a case study, we will discuss the role that universities and university level research have played and continue to play in public life. We will discuss what research looks like at a university, who does it, and who benefits. A survey of campus history will be complemented by close examination of primary sources, as well as discussions on finding and utilizing primary sources effectively. Tracking campus history to the present moment, we will then map our conversations onto current events for a larger discussion on writing research papers using both primary and secondary sources. Some of the issues that we will cover in our readings and discussions will include: how and where we find information, what types of information and what sources of information we find valuable, and what we do with the information we have access to. Over the course of the semester, students will embark on a process of discovery related to a key issue within their chosen topic, to determine where, how, and why their research holds particular relevance to our world today. List of Texts: Available for Purchase The Craft of Research, 4th edition (Booth, Wayne C.) Weaponized Lies: How to Think Critically in the Post-Truth Era (Levitin, Daniel J.) Available In Class, Online, or Through the Library Access to various primary sources, secondary sources, databases, and archives Varied texts (at least one book length text) related to your discovery project Reading, Composition, and Research: R4B “ ​ offers students structured, sustained, and highly articulated practice in the recursive processes entailed in reading and composing, as well as critical analysis. The seminar affords students guided practice through the stages involved in creating a research paper.” In response to class readings and original research, “students craft several short pieces leading up to two longer essays—works of exposition and/or argumentation. Students also draft a research paper, developing a research question, gathering, evaluating, and synthesizing information from texts and other sources. Elements of the research process, such as proposals, annotated bibliographies, abstracts, \"works cited\" lists, and the like, are submitted, along with the final report, in a research portfolio. Students write a minimum of 32 pages of expository prose during the semester.” This course satisfies the second half (Part B) of the Reading & Composition Requirement. Course Requirements: 1. ​ Students will be responsible for coming to class ready to discuss all readings assigned to them for that meeting. ​ This means bring all books and materials necessary for the day’s class ​ . You will be expected to engage in informed discussions pertaining to a text’s content, its formal features, its cultural context, or other relevant aspects as deemed necessary. 2. ​ Class time will regularly be devoted to discussion of daily readings and assignments, as well as topics related to writing and research. Students will frequently be asked to work together ​ in revision groups and/or research groups, ​ which will meet during class, and in some cases before, after, or between classes. 3. ​ During the semester you will be expected to keep a ​ writing/research notebook ​ and complete several informal and/or exploratory writing assignments in and out of class. 4. ​ ​ You are required to check your email twice daily ​ for messages related to this course. 5. ​ During the second half of the semester, students will be asked to create a portfolio of different materials and assignments related to the final research project and submit it for evaluation. STUDENTS ARE THEREFORE RESPONSIBLE TO KEEP COPIES OF ALL FORMAL AND INFORMAL MATERIAL CREATED DURING THE SEMESTER. Paper Submissions: In general, the graded papers due for this class will go through a multi-step process, with my input and the input from other students given at certain steps along the way. ​ When you submit drafts to me, you will do so using your “bDrive,” a Google platform for creating and exchanging documents that corresponds to the @berkeley.edu email address you were assigned when you were admitted to the university ​ . At the beginning of the semester you will receive a bDrive folder from me, which will be the repository for all of your draft writing this semester. When the course begins we will review how to upload your essays to bDrive, and how to use it as an interactive tool to work with me to improve your writing. When you are finished with the feedback and editing stages and ready to submit a final paper for evaluation, you will do so through our “bCourses” page. ​ Your papers should include a heading with one line for your name,  one line for the date, and one line with the course time and title. Papers should be typed using Times New Roman 12pt. font or Arial 11 font with margins set to 1 inch. All work is expected to be handed in ​ ON TIME ​ unless an extension is arranged in advance with me. Keep in mind that ​ without an approved late submission any incomplete assignments will be marked down accordingly ​ , having a negative impact on your final grade and potentially your ability to successfully complete the end of semester portfolio assignment. Course Policies: ● Be respectful of the rights, opinions, and differences of others. ● Please take advantage of my office hours and/or email whenever you have a question, or if you just want to talk about something related to the course. ● Academic integrity refers to a set of core values that guide our conduct and decisions as members of the UC Berkeley community.  Plagiarism and cheating contradict these values, and can be very serious academic offenses. Consequences for not adhering to these values can range from a failing grade on an assignment to suspension from the University. This quarter we will address research and citation methods that will help you avoid plagiarism, however you should also review the University's definitions of misconduct regarding this matter to help inform your study at http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity/definition UC Berkeley Honor Code: \"As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.\" A Note on Course Engagement: Engagement counts for fifteen percent of your grade. There is no one way to show engagement, but in general it can be demonstrated through combinations of: attending and participating in full and small group live sessions, working through course modules and staying active and visible on bCourses (discussion boards, etc.), completing activities and quizzes on time, participating in group work and with revision groups, completing live session freewriting tasks, working actively and regularly throughout the semester, note-taking, meeting with me during office hours, corresponding with me by email, asking questions outside of class sessions, or demonstrating interest through pursuit of information related to the class on your own. ​ Attendance in full group live sessions isn’t required in our course, but engagement with these sessions is still critical to your success.  This means that if you can’t make it to a live session, it is your responsibility to watch the posted recordings. Complete the live session check-in after every meeting. You are also responsible to complete all in-session tasks you missed in a timely manner. ​ Punctuality for meetings and sessions is also important. Student Learning Center: The SLC offers a variety of peer based programs to help students write academic papers. The center also offers drop-in sessions with tutors for all students and workshops for non-native English speakers. They are located in the Chavez Student Center across from Sproul Hall. Their number is 642-7332 and their web address is ​ ​ http://slc.berkeley.edu ​ . Other Student Resources: Your physical and emotional health and well-being are important to me, and essential for your long term success! ​ Please take a moment to review some of the ​ resources available to students ​ and always feel comfortable and encouraged to talk to me if there is something going on that is interfering with your ability to succeed, or if you simply feel like you need to talk. Grades: All semester grades, once given, are final. Grades for papers are generally given after a full round of commenting and revision on a paper. They will always be given numerically. The relationship between numerical grading and letter grading is expressed in the following chart (decimals are always rounded down): // ​ A+ ​ 95-100 // ​ A ​ 93-94// ​ A- ​ 90-92 // ​ B+ ​ 87-89 // ​ B ​ 83-86 // ​ B- ​ 80-82 // // ​ C+ ​ 77-79 // ​ C ​ 73-76 // ​ C- ​ 70-72 // ​ D (NP) ​ 60-69 // ​ F (NP) ​ 59 and Below // Breakdown of Semester Grade: 10%  Working With Primary Sources (Essay #1) 10%  Sources in Context (Essay #2) 10%  Discovery Pathways (2 write-ups and 2 presentations @2.5% each) 05%  Prospectus 10%  Research Fair Presentation and Slide Deck 10%  Annotated Bibliography 20%  Research Paper 10%  Homework, Drafting, and Small Assignments (graded holistically) 15%  Course Engagement (Live sessions and group meetings- graded holistically) (Note: In-class journaling, freewriting, and small homework assignments are not always collected, but may be in certain cases.

In Spring 2021, CS10 is expanding upon last fall's teaching plan to better support students and encourage participation during this unusual online offering of the course. Special thank you to John DeNero and the CS61A team for writing the original document which this was based on. This course allows time conflicts! Collaboration, Not Competition You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material, but (unless specified otherwise) all your graded work should be your own. Academic integrity and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, especially with online offerings. We want to remind you that this course is graded on an absolute scale – that means that there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you donʼt have to feel the pressure of having to cheat to get your A. Youʼre competing against an absolute scale, and you can all (in theory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make small bin adjustments if the GPA of the class is below the department suggested range, so we might adjust your score up, but itʼll never be adjusted down). Flexibility and Community Online classes taught during a time of wildfires, power outages, and a worldwide pandemic need to have policies that support students in different living situations, and in different time zones. They need to have a way that the students can get to know each other, learn from each other, and study with each other. They need to have a way the course staff can get to know their students, and (most importantly) check in with them to make sure their health and learning is going ok. The deadlines need to have flexibility in case a student or team needs some more time to finish a project or homework. We believe we have built all of that into our class this semester. Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning Research (and anecdotal evidence) have shown that students who keep up with the material every week do better than students who fall behind, start projects late, and have to cram for each exam at the last minute. So, as much as you can, attend our face-to-face live session (Mon @ 11am PST … but Wed when Monday is a holiday) + a discussion (3 different times) synchronously. However, you will not be penalized for being in a time zone that makes that difficult, and you will find recordings of these sessions available. The only required synchronous elements are a weekly 15m check-in with you and three other students with video on (with exceptions on a student-by-student basis), but will have many times throughout the day available for that, and getting your lab checked off at a lab section. Sections Course Elements We have a few different components to this course, all of which we have tried to optimize for online learning. Lectures Lecture content has been pre-recorded with high production value. There will be questions to answer via PrairieLearn after every lecture, for which you will earn credit. On Mondays at 11 AM, there will be a live weekly summary lecture on Zoom with Dan. All content will be the same as in the recordings, but in less depth. You are required to watch the recording and encouraged (but not required) to attend the live sessions. If Monday is a holiday, the live session will be Wednesday. The live session wil also be recorded. Lab Location: Discord. We will have three labs scheduled through the day to be sensitive to differences in time zones. Lab attendance is encouraged and will be counted towards extra credit, but is not mandatory. However, labs are required to be checked off at one of the lab sections (i.e. synchronously). If you are unable to attend any of the sections, please contact Shannon. Discussion Location: Zoom. Discussion content will be pre-recorded. However, we will also have three live discussion sections. Discussion attendance is encouraged and will be counted towards extra credit, but is not mandatory. CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing"

In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. We will also use other languages in the latter half of the course, including the Scheme programming language. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side e\u0000ect of CS 61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will \u0000nd that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work. A complete list of lecture topics, readings, and assignments appears in the daily schedule (/). Prerequisites Math 1A is listed as a corequisite for CS 61A. (That is, it may be taken concurrently.) Math 10A or Math 16A are also \u0000ne. It is possible to take CS 61A without knowing or learning calculus; all of the old calculus-based examples have been removed over the years. However, taking calculus is a great way to brush up on the arithmetic and algebra that appear regularly in CS 61A. 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 2/12There are no formal programming-related prerequisites for CS 61A, but it's not the right \u0000rst course for all students. Many CS 61A students have had signi\u0000cant prior programming experience, including prior coursework. Some students take the course without any prior programming experience, but they typically must work substantially harder to master the material. If you have limited prior experience and you \u0000nd it challenging to complete all of the required coursework in the \u0000rst three weeks, please consider taking another course \u0000rst. You'll likely have a better experience taking 61A later, and you won't fall behind in any meaningful way by taking a preparatory class \u0000rst. Prepar atory Classes If you want to build programming experience before taking CS 61A, we recommend that you \u0000rst take a class that introduces you to programming. The most appropriate class within the Berkeley CS department is CS 10, described below, but you may also \u0000nd similar classes at Berkeley extension or in online courses. Feel free to contact course sta\u0000 (/contact/) if you are not sure what's best. CS 10 CS 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing (http://cs10.org) is an introductory computer science course which is similar to CS 61A but moves at a friendlier pace. CS 10 covers variables, functions, recursion, algorithmic complexity, object-oriented programming, and many other relevant CS 61A topics, with the overall content overlap being about 50%. CS 10 starts the semester in Snap!, a block-based programming language which allows students to focus on conceptual understanding without worrying about unfamiliar syntax. After the midterm, the course transitions into Python (the primary language 61A uses), applying the same concepts you already learned to the new language, as well as introducing new concepts more relevant to Python. CS 10 also covers big ideas and social implications that go beyond programming, showing you the beauty and joy of computing. Alternativ e Classes Data 8 and CS 88 If you are majoring in data science, the pathway of Data 8 plus CS 88 is the recommended way for you to learn programming, since it is designed for data science students and will introduce you to many of the core concepts. Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science (http://data8.org/) is an introduction to data science designed to be accessible and useful for all Berkeley students. This course was built for students without prior programming experience. It teaches students to program in Python 3, 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 3/12but covers a much smaller subset of the language than CS 61A. Most of the course focuses on data processing and statistical techniques that are central to using computers to answer questions about the world. CS 88: Computational Structures in Data Science (https://cs88-website.github.io/) is an introduction to programming and computing that has more than 50% concept overlap with CS 61A. It is designed for students interested in data science who want to expand their knowledge of programming and program structures beyond what is covered in Data 8. Students who complete CS 88 can either proceed directly to CS 61B or subsequently take CS 61A, a path that o\u0000ers a substantial amount of review because of the high topic overlap between the courses. Course F ormat The course includes many events and opportunities for learning: lecture, lab, discussion, tutorials, o\u0000ce hours, parties, lost sections, and exam prep. We understand that everyone learns di\u0000erently, so not all of these events are required. However, it is recommended that you try everything out to \u0000gure out what combination of these events works best for you. Lectur e Lectures will be held live over Zoom 2:10pm-3pm PDT, starting on Wednesday 1/20. For students who cannot attend live, recordings will be posted to the website afterwards. This course moves fast, and lecture is tightly coordinated with section. Please attend or watch each lecture before attending lab and discussion orientation. Section Lab The goal of each week's lab is to provide you with some programming practice. Lab assignments are similar to homework assignments, but the problems are more straightforward, and you're welcome to work through lab assignments with other students. To get you started, each week's lab will begin with a short online orientation from one of the course GSIs. These are held at times TBD. All lab orientations will be recorded (but attend one live so you can ask questions). Once you've attended a lab orientation, complete the lab assignment that day. There are several ways to get help and work with other students on lab assignments, which will be described during the lab orientation. The best way to \u0000nd other students to collaborate with 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 4/12is to attend a lab party, described below. We will release a form on Piazza to help you \u0000nd partners to work with! Discussion & T utorials Discussion sections provide problem-solving guidance and practice. Each discussion section has two parts: an orientation and a tutorial. The 50-minute orientation sessions are held at times TBD. These will be recorded (but attend one live so you can ask questions). Please watch an orientation before attending your weekly tutorial. Small-group tutorials o\u0000er problem solving with the same group of around 6-10 students each week. Each 50-minute tutorial will focus on particular questions from the week’s discussion worksheet. You can ask any questions you want during the tutorial, but please come prepared by attending an orientation \u0000rst. If you do not attend orientation, you will likely have a tough time keeping up in tutorial, as your tutor will assume that you have already understood part of the worksheet in orientation. O\u0000ce Hours Our virtual o\u0000ce hours are one-on-one meetings with a course tutor in which you can ask questions and get help. You can join the o\u0000ce hours queue at oh.cs61a.org (https://oh.cs61a.org). Each week's schedule of o\u0000ce hours (when we are helping students on the queue) appears in the weekly o\u0000ce hours schedule (/o\u0000ce-hours/). We will try hard to make sure that enough sta\u0000 are available to meet o\u0000ce hours demand, but there will likely be some time this semester when demand exceeds supply. Please be patient as we try to support all the students in the course. Try a Piazza private post if you can't \u0000nd timely help with a sta\u0000 member. Study Gr oup In addition to the o\u0000ce hours queue, you can collaborate with other students working on the same assignment using the Study Group tool (https://oh.cs61a.org/party). If the whole group you form wants help from a sta\u0000 member, you can request help any time that the o\u0000ce hours queue is available. Parties 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 5/12For students who prefer a more collaborative environment in which they can discuss problems with other students, we will o\u0000er Zoom-based lab, homework, and project parties each week. Students and sta\u0000 will work together to solve problems. Try one out and see if you like it. Assignments Each week, there will be problems assigned for you to work on, most of which will involve writing and analyzing programs. These assignments come in three categories: lab exercises, homework assignments, and projects. Labs Lab exercises are designed to introduce a new topic. All labs are released on Monday morning and due Tuesday at 11:59 PM, with the exception of Lab 0, which will be due on the same day as Lab 1. Lab exercises are scored on correct completion. To receive credit, you must complete all of the problems that are not marked as optional and pass all tests. There is no partial credit on labs. Homework Weekly homework assignments let you apply the concepts learned in lecture and section to more challenging problems. They will usually be released on Friday night and be due the following Thursday night. Collabor ation P olicy You are encouraged to discuss homework questions with other students, as long as you write your own code and submit your own work. Finding a study group is a great idea. The purpose of homework is for you to learn the course material, not to prove that you already know it. Therefore, you can expect to receive substantial assistance from the course sta\u0000. You're welcome to help others once you solve a problem. You are not allowed to copy solutions or share your solution to a question with other students who haven't completed the question already. You are not allowed to use solutions that you \u0000nd on the internet. If you are stuck on a problem, come get help instead of copying the answer from someone else or the Internet; you'll still get credit and won't be \u0000agged for cheating. 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 6/12Partial Cr edit Homework is scored out of 2 points, and every incorrect solution costs you a point. Your lowest homework score will be dropped from your point total for the semester. Homework Reco very Policy You can recover one question per homework by going through the homework recovery process: \u0000\u0000\u0000Fill out a form declaring which question you want to recover by Friday 11:59PM, the day after the homework is due. \u0000\u0000\u0000Join the recovery session for that question the following week. These sessions are not recorded; you must attend live to receive recovery credit. Recovery sessions describe how to approach and solve a past homework problem. You are welcome to attend these even if you don't need the recovery point. Projects Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. You are allowed and encouraged to pair program (/articles/pair-programming) with a partner. Make sure to alternate roles so that both of you understand the complete results. We recommend \u0000nding a partner in your tutorial group, but course sta\u0000 will also provide a partner matching form at various points in the semester. It is your responsibility to contact and collaborate with your partner; we cannot guarantee that your partnership works out. You may also work alone on all projects, although partners are recommended. Projects are graded on both correctness and composition (/articles/composition). Exams Each exam has a scheduled time, but students in time zones for which the exam would start between 8pm and 6am (inclusive) or with con\u0000icting midterm exams may request an alternate exam time. Details for this request will be shared before the exam date. Midterm 1 will be held 5-7pm PST Wednesday, 2/17. Midterm 2 will be held 5-7pm PST Friday, 3/19. The \u0000nal exam will be held 11:30am-2:30pm Tuesday, 5/11. 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 7/12We will not be providing alternates for those with con\u0000icting \u0000nal exams unless it is due to a DSP accommodation. Please review the Spring 2021 Final Exam Groups (https://registrar.berkeley.edu/scheduling/academic-scheduling/\u0000nal-exam-guide- schedules) before the add/drop deadline. Exams will be web-based multiple-choice and \u0000ll-in-the-blank, in a similar format to the Fall 2020 exams. Exam Pr octoring All exams will be proctored through Zoom (https://berkeley.zoom.us). \u0000\u0000\u0000Before the exam: Download Zoom on your smartphone and determine how you will set up your phone to proctor your work. Please reach out privately on Piazza if you are having setup di\u0000culties. Example setups are here: https://cs161.org/sample-setups On the night before the exam, make sure you’ve received an email with a Zoom meeting link. \u0000\u0000\u0000On the day of the exam: Join the Zoom meeting from your smartphone and position your smartphone so that we can clearly see all screens you are using and both of your hands. Mute yourself. \u0000\u0000\u0000Technical issues: Don’t worry if your video feed disconnects brie\u0000y during the exam. If you encounter signi\u0000cant technical problems, don’t worry about video proctoring and focus on \u0000nishing the exam. If you need to use the bathroom, just leave the video feed on while you’re away. Resour ces Textbook The online textbook for the course is Composing Programs (http://composingprograms.com/), which was created speci\u0000cally for this course, based on the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/\u0000les/sicp/index.html). Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule. We recommend that you complete the readings before attending lecture. Grading 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 8/12Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 300 points. Midterm 1, worth 40 points. Midterm 2, worth 50 points. The \u0000nal exam, worth 75 points. Four projects, worth 100 points. Homework, worth 18 points. Lab, worth 11 points. Tutorials, worth 6 points. There are a handful extra credit points throughout the semester, perhaps around 10, that are available to everyone. Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores: A+   ≥ 300    A   ≥  285    A-   ≥  270 B+   ≥ 250    B   ≥  225    B-   ≥  205 C+   ≥ 190    C   ≥  180    C-   ≥  175 D+   ≥ 170    D   ≥  165    D-   ≥  160 Your \u0000nal score will be rounded to the nearest integer before being converted to a letter grade. 0.5 rounds up to 1, but 0.49 rounds down to 0. There is no curve; your grade will depend only on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else does. Score thresholds are based on how students performed in previous semesters. Unlike some previous semesters you may have heard about, these thresholds will not be adjusted based on student performance. These are the exact thresholds that will be used at the end of the course to assign grades. In a typical semester, about 60% of students taking the course for a letter grade will receive a B+ or higher. Incomplete grades will be granted only for medical or personal emergencies that cause you to miss the \u0000nal or last part of the course, only for students who have completed the majority of the coursework, and only if work up to the point of the emergency has been satisfactory. Your lowest homework score will be dropped. Each lab that you complete is worth 1 point, and you can receive a maximum of 11 lab points. There are going to be 13 lab assignments, so you can skip two and still get full credit. Lab 00 is not graded, and Labs 04 and 08 are midterm review labs that everyone will receive points for. There is no Lab 09. Each tutorial you attend is worth 1 point, excluding the tutorial just after the \u0000rst lecture. You can receive a maximum of 6 tutorial points. There are going to be around 12 tutorials, so you can skip many, but you should really continue to attend tutorial throughout the semester because they are useful. Tutorial 0 attendance does not count for points, but we suggest that you attend to get to know your tutor and the people in the section. 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 9/12Tutorial P articipation Attending more than 6 tutorials will contribute to recovery points on midterms. Attending at least 10 tutorials will give you the maximum amount of midterm recovery. We calculate your midterm recovery using the following logic, where attendance  is the number of weeks that you attend tutorial. def exam_recovery (your_exam_score, attendance, max_exam_score, cap= 10): half_score = max_exam_score / 2 max_recovery = max( 0, (half_score - your_exam_score) / 2) recovery_ratio = min(attendance, cap) / cap return max_recovery * recovery_ratio According to this formula, if you receive more than half the available points on each midterm, then you don't recover any points. If you score just below half the points, you will recover a few points. If you score far below half the points, you will recover many points. The more weeks you attend tutorial, the more exam points will be recovered. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all students who continue to invest time in the course througout the semester are able to pass. There are no recovery points available on the \u0000nal exam. Late P olicy If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact course sta\u0000 (/contact/) and your partner as early as possible. Depending on the circumstance, we may grant extensions. Labs: We rarely accept late lab submissions. Homework: We rarely accept late homework submissions. Projects: Submissions within 24 hours after the deadline will receive 75% of the earned score. Submissions that are 24 hours or more after the deadline will receive 0 points. Citiz enship For exceptionally rude or disrespectful behavior toward the course sta\u0000 or other students, your \u0000nal grade will be lowered by up to a full letter grade (e.g., from an A- to a B-) at the discretion of the course instructors. You don't need to be concerned about this policy if you treat other human beings with even a bare minimum of respect and consideration and do not engage in behavior that is actively harmful to others. Learning Cooper atively 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 10/12With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will de\u0000nitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally. Learning cooperatively is di\u0000erent from sharing answers. You shouldn't be showing your code to other students or looking at others' code, except: During lab, you can share all you want as long as you're all learning. For a project that allows partners, you can share anything with your partner. If you've \u0000nished a problem already, you can look at others' code to help them \u0000nish. If you are helping another student, don't just tell them the answer; they will learn very little and run into trouble on exams. Instead, try to guide them toward discovering the solution on their own. Problem solving practice is the key to progress in computer science. Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody  is depending on you to do something you can't \u0000nish. Online F orum If you have any questions, please post them to Piazza (http://www.piazza.com/berkeley/spring2021/cs61a), the course discussion forum. Piazza allows you to learn from questions your fellow students have asked. We encourage you to answer each others' questions! Piazza is the best and most reliable way to contact the course sta\u0000. There is an option to make a Private post, if you would prefer. If you need to share sensitive information that you would only like the Head TAs and instructors to see, you should email us (/contact/). Academic Honesty The minimum penalty for any students caught collaborating on exams will be negative points on that exam. Please don't be one of these students. Assignment cooperation has a limit, and in CS 61A that limit is reading others' homework or project solution to a problem before you solve that problem on your own. You are free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but you must write your own solutions. You may share code with your project partner. If you are unsure if what you are doing is cheating, please clarify with the instructor or contact course sta\u0000 (/contact). The following is a list of things you should NOT do. This list is not exhaustive, but covers most of the big o\u0000enses: Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner. 4/9/2021 Syllabus & Course Policies | CS 61A Spring 2021 https://cs61a.or g/articles/about/ 11/12Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from you. Do not copy solutions from online sources such as Stack Over\u0000ow, Pastebin, and public repositories on GitHub. Do not post your solutions publicly during or after the semester. If you \u0000nd a solution online, please submit a link to that solution anonymously (https://goo.gl/forms/nL2yOj1Z81HcQYDi2). When we \u0000nd an online solution, we ask the author to remove it. We also record the solution and use it to check for copying. By reporting online solutions, you help keep the course fair for everyone. In summary, we expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete projects with code written only by you and your partner. The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you learn, which is why you are here. Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The entire sta\u0000 is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers. A Parting Thought Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of this course. We really just want you to learn. The entire sta\u0000 is very excited to be teaching CS 61A this semester and we're looking forward to meeting such a large and enthusiastic group of students. We want all of you to be successful here. Welcome to CS 61A!"

However, you’ll hopefully find the answers to any logistics questions you may have somewhere in this document. Welcome to CS 61B The CS 61 series is an introduction to Computer Science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer’s point of view. CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming. In CS 61A, the correctness of a program was our primary goal. In CS 61B, we’re also concerned with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of CS 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We’ll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs. Background Knowledge This class assumes you have taken CS 61A, CS 88, or E 7, or have equivalent background to a student who has taken one of these courses. The course is largely built upon the assumption that you have taken CS 61A. CS 88 and E7 students may find the beginning of the course to be a bit scarier, particularly when it comes to object oriented programming. We assume you are coming in with zero Java experience. Nonetheless, we will move through basic Java syntax very quickly. Though the syntaxes of Java, Python, MATLAB, Scheme, etc. are enormously different, the underlying computational models are surprisingly similar. If you already have Java experience, great! We hope that you’ll help out your fellow students in discussion, lab, and on our class forum, particularly in the opening weeks when everyone is catching up on Java. Is this the right course for me? This is a course about data structures and programming methods. It happens to also teach Java, since it is hard to teach programming without a language. However, it is not intended as an exhaustive course on Java, creating Android apps, user interfaces, graphics, or any of that fun stuff. Some of you may have already taken a data structures course, and simply want to learn Java or C++. For you, self-study may be a better option. CS 9F (C++ for programmers) and CS 9G (Java for programmers) are both one-unit self-paced courses that will teach you more of what you want to know in less time. There is no enrollment limit for that course, and you work through it at your own pace after the first and only lecture. Finally, the 1-unit self-paced course CS 47B is for students with “sufficient partial credit in 61B,” allowing them (with instructor’s permission) to complete the CS 61B course requirement without taking the full course. The 47B guide is at this link. Lectures, Discussion and Lab Sections Rather than presenting lecture material during our officially scheduled lecture time of MW, 1-2 PM, Josh Hug will lead a live Q&A session with no specific pre-planned activities. On Friday, the live Q&A will be at 2 PM. Lecture material will instead be presented in pre-recorded videos, currently available on the course website. However, Lecture 1 and some other lectures will be presented live during the regularly scheduled period. We will announce on our course forum when live lectures will take place. Each week there is a 1-hour Discussion section and a 2-hour Lab section headed by a TA. Discussion sections feature a worksheet with problems reviewing the material learned in the past week. In discussion sections, TAs will help students review the material and solve the problems on the worksheet. Discussion sections will be delivered on Zoom. Lab sections feature coding assignments that students submit for credit. In these sections, TAs will introduce the assignment, review relevant material, and answer students’ questions. In some weeks, Lab TAs will also go over the staff’s solution to the lab assignment. Lab sections are also supported by academic interns. Labs will take place on Discord servers. To learn how to use our Discord servers, please refer to our Discord Guide . Information about the staff running each section can be found on the staff page. Section signups, the Zoom meeting links, and Discord information for each TA will be available on our course forum, Ed, shortly before classes start. The schedule of all sections and lectures can be found at the bottom of our course website’s main page . Discussion and lab attendance are not mandatory. However, there are 2 (EDITED 2/16) labs for which attendance is mandatory for full credit: Lab 5 (Project 1 code review lab), and Lab 15 (Project 3 demo lab). These labs include an assignment for which you will need to get checked-off by a TA to receive credit. These labs cannot be submitted late (see lateness policy below). Sections are meant to provide an opportunity for students and TAs to engage in meaningful interactions, so students who attend discussion and/or lab sections will be required to have their video turned on for the entirety of the section. If your video is turned off for more than a few minutes, you will automatically be removed from the section. For students who prefer to not attend section due to this requirement, the discussion worksheet, solutions, and recorded videos of TAs walking through the solutions will be available on the course website every week after all discussion sections have been taught. Lab assignments will also be available on the course website, and students who wish to not attend a lab section can get help in Office Hours and on our course forum, Ed. If you choose to not sign up for a lab to attend regularly, for the mandatory attendance labs, you will have the following options: ● Lab 5: You will be able to attend any lab that works with your schedule. Mandatory video-on will not be enforced for this lab only, but will be encouraged. ● Lab 15: There will be official sign ups for this checkoff, in which you and your partner will present the work you completed for Project 3. The signups will be available shortly before the last week of classes. Mandatory video-on will not be enforced for this checkoff, but will be encouraged. Mentor GSIs All students will be assigned a mentor TA. Your mentor TA will keep an eye out for you, and will also be your point-of-contact for issues when you need help with course policies, strategies for studying, and any other advice. Please refrain from asking your mentor TA for help with course assignment, as it is against our staff policy to offer help outside of sections, Office Hours, or our course forum, Ed. During the second week of classes you will be able to choose your mentor TA, who does not necessarily have to be your discussion or lab TA. If you don’t choose one, you will be randomly assigned a mentor TA. At various points throughout the class, your mentor TA will reach out to you. Online Resources The course home page will provide one-stop shopping for course information. The course schedule as well as all handouts, homework, labs, FAQs, etc., will be posted there. Our discussion forum this semester will be Ed Discussions . For most questions about the course, Ed is the right place to ask them. The course staff reads it regularly, so you will get a quick answer. Furthermore, by posting online as opposed to emailing us directly, other students benefit by seeing the question and the answer. Don’t forget to check Ed before asking your question, just in case someone else has already posted it. If you have a question about something pertaining to your own code that shouldn’t be shared with the class, or if you have a question about a personal matter, you can make a private post on Ed, which will only be seen by Josh and the TAs. Please read our Ed Guide and Policies . We will only respond to questions that adhere to our policies of using Ed. The e-mail address cs61b (at) berkeley.edu will send a message to the course staff (Josh and the head TAs). You can use it for correspondence that you don’t want to seen on our class forum. The head TAs and Josh all read it, so you will usually get a reply within a few days. If you send a question that is of general interest, we may post the response on Ed (we will keep personal information out of it, of course). If you have any problems that require an exception to course policy (e.g. medical emergencies or sudden necessary travel that result in extended absences), please contact cs61b (at) berkeley.edu. Please do not email Josh for exceptions. Email cs61b (at) berkeley.edu. In the beginning of the semester, we will issue each student a Github repository on which you will save your work for the different CS 61B assignments. You will use this repository to submit the assignments as well. We will also use Github to share skeleton files with you. Finally, for every partnership you establish you will get a dedicated “partners’ repository” from which you will submit assignments on which you collaborated on with another student (more details below). Information on how to get started with your Github repository will be available in Lab 1. After you submit an assignment through Github, you will be able to see the results for a submission you made on Gradescope, where we run our autograders. Information on how to use Gradescope in CS 61B will be available in Lab 1. In general whenever we release an assignment on the course website, we also release its grader on Gradescope. You can only run the grader 3 times an hour. This is to dissuade you from using the grader to debug your code, only making small changes between submissions. Some projects will have different release schedules and restrictions for their graders. For example, the grader of a project may only be released shortly before the deadline, and/or allow only a few submissions per day. Whenever we release an assignment with irregular grader details, we will specify them on Ed. Rather than using bcourses, we will be using our own custom learning management system called Beacon located at beacon.datastructur.es . You can use Beacon to keep track of your grades and late assignments, and you will also use it to specify your lab partner and mentor GSI. You can also read our full guide on Beacon here . Office Hours In Office Hours, you can get help from our staff and academic interns with the different assignments, exam preparation, logistical matters, and any advice you may need. You will be able to find the link to the Office Hours Discord Server on our course forum, Ed. To learn how to use our Discord servers and how Office Hours works please read our Discord Guide . We will use the online Office Hours queue to keep track of students in Office Hours. Staff will always skip tickets on the queue that do not adhere to our Office Hours policies. Course Materials There is no required textbook for the class. There is an online textbook written by myself and a large team of former TAs. It can be found at https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b . If you find these notes insufficient, you might consider consulting Paul Hilfinger’s (free) Java Reference or Head First Java, 2nd Edition by Sierra and Bates (O’Reilly, 2005) . These are not required for the course. The optional textbook for the weeks 5-14 of the course is Algorithms, 4th Edition by Wayne and Sedgewick. All textbooks for this course are optional. Homework will not be assigned from them. Only alternate readings will be provided from them when possible. The official description of the Java core language is available online in The Java Language Specification (Java SE 15 Edition) by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele, Gilad Bracha, Alex Buckley, Daniel Smith, and Gavin Bierman. It’s extremely thorough and easy to read (once you understand how to read it). Software This official coding environment and text editor for the course is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called IntelliJ. At your own discretion, you may instead use Vim, Emacs, Sublime, or IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, etc. Whatever you use, however, your submitted solutions must conform to our expected style guide . We strongly recommend that you use IntelliJ starting as soon as possible. We will not officially support any editing / programming environment other than IntelliJ. This semester, we will use Java 15. You will be able to do any work you’d like on any Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux computer. Information for setting up your own computer is linked in Lab 1. We’ll be using the version-control system Git this semester. Version-control systems allow you to maintain a series of “snapshots” of your files at various points in their development. Used properly, this provides you some back-up protection, so that you can recover previous states of your work when something goes wrong. Also for team-oriented projects (as well as in the real world), version-control systems help manage collaborative work. You will be learning and using Git for this course to track your work and submit your assignments. In addition to the advantages above, using Git will allow the staff to track your progress in the course and maybe even help you out when you’re stuck on bugs. The first lab will teach you the basics of what you will need to know. Feel free to also read official Git documentation . Expected Coursework There are five required aspects of the course for which you earn points: 1. Weekly Surveys 2. HWs 3. Lab Assignments 4. Projects 5. Exams In addition, there are many opportunities to earn extra credit. Weekly Survey While lecture and section attendance is not required, nor even expected, we do expect you to stay up to date with material. To help us keep track of your progress and sentiment about the course, there will be 14 weekly surveys due on Mondays at 11:59 PM. Each weekly survey is worth 32 points, for a total of 320 points. Only your top 10 weekly surveys are counted (out of 14). No late surveys will be accepted. HW and Lab Assignments There are 14 weeks of lab in the course, as well as 3 required homework. During Phase I of the course (Weeks 1 through 5), labs will provide you with help getting your computer set up and teach you how to use essential Java programming tools, and will also include a peer code review after we’re done with Project 1. During Phases II and III of the course (Weeks 6 - 14), labs will usually involve implementation of some data structure or algorithm described in lecture. All labs should take no more than two hours to complete, though some may run slightly longer. You will turn in everything electronically using GitHub, and your results will be available on Gradescope. Labs will receive full credit for “reasonable effort,” as evaluated by a small number of relatively simple correctness tests. Alternatively, some lab assignments may not require you to pass all the tests on Gradescope to get full credit. There are no hidden tests. Homework assignments will be conceptual assignments normally due shortly before each exam to help you study for the exams. They will be available on Gradescope and include a combination of multiple choice and fill-in-the-blanks questions. You can expect to have to work out these problems on paper before filling in your answer on Gradescope. Out of the 14 labs, only 10 will entail an assignment you need to submit. Each of these 10 labs will be worth 64 points (for a total of 640 points), and each homework will be worth 320 points (for a total of 960 points). No homework or labs will be dropped. Partnerships Coronavirus makes the world lonely. This semester, we are allowing lab partners for lab assignments. You will be able to select your own lab partner or request to be paired up with another student. You and your lab partner will be able to submit the exact same code for lab assignments under some restrictions. Having a partner is optional for labs. For Project 3, all students will be required to work with a partner. You will either be able to choose a partner to work with or request to be paired up with another student who has similar working habits and goals as you. If you have a lab partner, you can either continue to work with your lab partner on Project 3, choose to work with a new partner, or request to be paired up with another student. One of the main goals of CS 61B is to give you the tools to become a successful software engineer, one of which is the ability to work effectively with others. Barring extreme circumstances, we will not approve for students to officially work alone on Project 3. If you think you have a compelling reason for working alone on Project 3, we will release form that you can fill out closer to the release of the project (keep an eye on Ed for this) - we will let you know if your request is approved shortly before the release of Project 3. Full details on partnerships can be found here . Programming Projects In addition to the HWs and labs, there will be 4 programming projects. In these projects you will build an entire system. All projects except project 3 must be completed on your own. For project 3 you will be required to work with a partner, unless you specifically request otherwise. If you think you can’t work with a partner on this project, we will have a form for you to fill out requesting to work alone closer to the project release date. Note that requests to work alone are unlikely to be approved. Project 0 and 1 will be relatively easier than projects 2 and 3, taking less time and with greater levels of scaffolding. Project 2 will be a difficult project (on par with what you might expect from a Hilfinger project), though it will be spread over a long period of time. Project 3 will be a capstone project in which you will design a project from scratch. Depending on how ambitious you are, it might end up being much more work than project 2. Each project has a specific theme: Project 0 (2048): Introduction to Java Project 1 (Deques): Basic Design, Testing, and Code Review Project 2 (TBA): Design, Large Scale Implementation Project 3 (BYOW): Large Scale Design Projects will have different grader release schedule and restrictions on the number of allowed submissions per a time interval. Full grader details will be provided on Ed with the release of each project. Project 3 will have an autograded portion and a checkoff portion. All tests will be released for the autograder portion. Projects 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be worth 640, 640, 1600, and 1600 points respectively. Exams Midterm 1 (Wed, 2/10, 8-10 PM CA Time) will be worth 1280 points, midterm 2 (Wed, 3/17, 7-9 PM CA Time) will be worth 1920 points, and the final exam (Tue, 5/11, 8-11AM CA Time) will be worth 3200 points. You will be allowed to use unlimited handwritten sheets of notes on all exams. You will not be required to turn in these sheets, and you may reuse them from exam to exam. Inspired by the great Paul Hilfinger tradition, exam questions may cover any material whatsoever. For fear of our lives, exams will almost exclusively test material covered in the course. CS 61B exams will be proctored. You will need to record yourself taking every exam using Zoom. It is your responsibility to know and follow our proctoring policy closely. All the details about our proctoring process can be found in our Exam Proctoring Guide (will be released leading up to Midterm 1). We will not grade exams for students who did not follow the process described in this guide exactly, regardless of the circumstances. If you do not follow our proctoring policy correctly, or you had any proctoring issue with a midterm exam, that exam will be clobbered by your final exam score (see “exam clobbering” below). If you have a proctoring issue on the final exam, you may need to take the class for an Incomplete grade and take the final exam in a future semester (Summer 2021 or Fall 2021). Please thoroughly read the Exam Proctoring Guide before making any inquiries about the proctoring process. There will be no alternate midterm exams. If you miss an exam, your score will be reweighted with your performance on other exams (see “exam clobbering” below). Students with disabilities that require alternate exam timing will be honored, so long as you can make a time that overlaps the official time. If you have a disability that prevents your ability to make such a time, we will discuss alternate arrangements with you directly. If you are traveling on official UC business, and have a proctor available, we will allow remote exams to be taken at the same time as the official exam. Alternate finals will be given in case of a direct final conflict only. If you miss a final exam due to illness, you will be given an Incomplete grade in the course and will have to complete the final exam during a future semester. We release grades for exams on Gradescope . If you believe we have misgraded an exam, request a regrade on Gradescope with a note explaining your complaint. You should check the official solutions first to make sure that this regrade will make your total score go up as it is possible to lose points from a regrade request. More details about regrade requests will be provided when we release exam grades. Due to the university level change in drop deadlines, Midterm 1 grades will be unavailable before the drop deadline. If you’re a prospective CS major and you are worried about dropping the course in the time before the drop deadline, please contact your mentor GSI and they may be able to provide you with some advice. Exam Clobbering For those of you who miss an exam, have a bad night, or make major improvements over the semester, the exam clobbering policy gives you a chance to replace potentially both of your midterm exam scores. Specifically, if it helps your score, we will replace your midterm scores by their “final statistical equivalent” (FSE). We compute the FSE of an exam as follows: Let F be the number of standard deviations above the mean that you score on the final. For example, if you are 0.3 standard deviations below the mean, F = −0.3. Let M be the class-wide mean (not including zeroes) on an midterm. Let σ be the class-wide standard deviations (not including zeroes) on a midterm. Your FSE for that exam is σ * F + M. The FSE cannot go above the maximum possible score for that exam. If your FSEs is better than your original midterm score, we will use the FSE instead. If both are better (e.g. you do much better on the final than either midterm), then we will replace both of the midterm scores. If both of your FSE are worse, nothing happens (i.e. doing badly on the final won’t hurt your earlier exam scores). Your grade can only go up with the clobbering policy, so if replacing your midterm scores with their FSE makes your grade lower we will not do that. Exam clobbering happens automatically after we have your final exam score. You don’t have to request exam clobbering to be applied. In pseudocode, clobbering works as follows: F = (your_final_score - final_mean) / final_stddev FSE_m1 = min(m1_stddev * F + m1_mean, 1280) // the max score for midterm 1 is 1280 FSE_m2 = min(m2_stddev * F + m2_mean, 1920) // the max score for midterm 2 is 1920 score_with_m1_replaced = FSE_m1 + your_m2_score + your_final_score score_with_m2_replaced = your_m1_score + FSE_m2 + your_final_score score_with_m1_and_m2_replaced = FSE_m1 + FSE_m2 + your_final_score score_with_no_replacements = your_m1_score + your_m2_score + your_final_score your_total_exam_score = max(score_with_m1_replaced, score_with_m2_replaced, score_with_m1_and_m2_replaced, score_with_no_replacements) Extra Credit Here is a list of extra credit opportunities in the course: ● 32 points: Taking the staff created pre-semester survey. ● 2 points: Submitting Project 0 a day before the deadline or earlier. ● 16 points: Submitting a portion of Project 1 early (details will be available on the Project spec). ● 32 points: Completing the extra-credit portion of Project 1 (details will be available on the Project spec). ● 32 points: Taking the staff created mid-semester survey. ● 16 points: Submitting a portion of Project 2 early (details will be available on the Project spec). ● 32 points: Completing the extra-credit portion of Project 2 (details will be available on the Project spec). ● 32 points: Completing the extra-credit portion of Project 3 (details will be available on the Project spec). ● 32 points: Taking the staff created end-of-semester survey. ● 32 points: Taking the official university end-of-semester survey. Point another way, there are 258 total points of extra credit: ● 128 points for the special surveys (not the same thing as the weekly surveys). ● 34 points for completing portions of assignments before the deadline. ● 96 points for completing extra-credit portions of projects. Grades Your letter grade will be determined by the total points out of the possible 12,800. In other words, there is no curving in this course, other than the clobbering policy above. Your grade will depend solely on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else does. Unlike other lower division CS courses, the grading bins for 61B generally do not get tweaked at the end of the semester. These bins were designed to comply with departmental guidelines that the average GPA for a lower-division required course be in the range 2.8 - 3.3 (including students who drop or take the class for a P/NP grade, given the special circumstances surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic). The design process involved setting of specific standards I expect students to achieve for the A, B, and C bins, with numbers adjusted and other bins interpolated based on a model that I built of predicted student performance. At the end of the semester, we might make the bin boundaries slightly friendlier, though as noted above, unlike other lower division CS courses, I don’t typically move them very much, if at all. Since the class is not curved, and we provide all the grading details above, occasionally students will only be “a few points away” from the next grading bin after they receive their final total points value. Please do not contact us in this case. We cannot “round up” your grade or give you credit for work you did not complete. If you ever find yourself unable to complete an assignment, please refer to our friendly lateness policy (details below), or contact us before the deadline. We will grant grades of Incomplete only for dire medical or personal emergencies that cause you to miss the final, and only if your work up to that point has been satisfactory. Do not try to get an incomplete simply as a way to have more time to study or do a project. That is contrary to University policy. Before requesting an Incomplete grade, please contact a college advisor or review your college’s Incomplete grade policies to understand if this is a right option for you. Policies on Collaboration, Cheating, and Lateness Deadlines can be stressful, and we know that under extreme pressure, it becomes tempting to start rationalizing actions that you would otherwise consider inappropriate. Perhaps you’ll find yourself facing a CS 61B project deadline, and under all this stress you’ll convince yourself that you’re just going to cheat for the moment so you can get the points, and that you’ll come back later and really learn the thing you were supposed to have learned in order to restore your karmic balance (I’ve heard something along these lines a few times). This is a terrible idea. Obviously it’s important to learn how to deal with deadlines, but far more important than that, giving into this sort of pressure under not-so-dire circumstances is going to do some damage to your moral compass. Someday, when the consequences are higher than potentially losing a 1/3rd of a letter grade, you may find yourself committing dishonest acts at the cost of someone else’s livelihood or life. Plagiarism on any homework, lab or project will result in a score of -200 on that assignment, which will likely reduce your letter grade by several bins. A second instance of plagiarism on a homework, lab, or project will result in an F in the course. All incidents of plagiarism will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct, including carelessly leaving code up on GitHub. Given our friendly lateness policy (see below), there will be no exceptions to this rule. During the Spring 2017 semester, we compiled a series of incident reports written by students who were caught plagiarizing . If you find yourself tempted to cheat, you might turn to the words of others who have made the wrong choice for guidance. In CS 61B, we have three types of assignments: homework, labs, and projects. The entire point of homework and labs is to learn. For homework or labs, you should feel free to collaborate with others however you choose, though keep in mind that greater independence is likely to give you a better learning experience (as long as you aren’t totally stuck). Even though we will allow close collaborations on HW and labs, the solutions you submit should still be your own work! Identical or near identical submissions will be treated as plagiarism. Lab partners will be allowed to submit identical code as long as the submission is made from their shared repository (details above). By contrast, the projects were designed not just for learning (particularly how to be self-reliant in the context of large unfamiliar systems), but also for the dual purpose of evaluating your mastery of the course material. As such, they are intended to be completed primarily on your own (or with your partner on the last project), particularly when it comes to writing the actual code. For exams, we will be absolutely unforgiving. Any incident will result in a failing grade for the course, though Berkeley will let you retake CS 61B next semester. As above, all incidents of cheating will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. What constitutes cheating? The golden rule of academic dishonesty is that you should not claim to be responsible for work that is not yours. This is obviously open to some interpretation, and you’ll be getting some help from instructors, the internet, other students, and more throughout the course. This is OK, and we hope that the class is an open, welcoming, collaborative environment where we can help each other build the highest possible understanding of the course material. To help (but not entirely define) the bounds of acceptable behavior, we have three important rules for projects: 1. By You Alone: All project code that you submit (other than skeleton code) should be written by you (and if applicable, lab partner on lab assignments and/or your partner on project 3) alone, except for small snippets that solve tiny subproblems (examples in the Permitted section below). 2. 3. Do Not Possess or Share Code: Before you’ve submitted your final work for a project, you should never be in possession of solution code that you (or your partner) did not write. You will be equally culpable if you distribute such code to other students or future students of 61B (within reason). DO NOT GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE – EVEN IF THEY ARE DESPERATELY ASKING. DO NOT POST SOLUTIONS TO PROJECTS ONLINE (on GitHub or anywhere else)! If you’re not sure what you’re doing is OK, please ask. 4. 5. Cite Your Sources: When you receive significant assistance on a project from someone else, you should cite that assistance somewhere in your source code with the @source tag as described in Lab 1. We leave it to you to decide what constitutes ‘significant’. For clarity, examples of specific activities are listed below: Permitted: ● Discussion of approaches for solving a problem. ● Giving away or receiving significant conceptual ideas towards a problem solution. Such help should be cited as comments in your code. For the sake of other’s learning experience, we ask that you try not to give away anything juicy, and instead try to lead people to such solutions. ● Discussion of specific syntax issues and bugs in your code. ● Using small snippets of code that you find online for solving tiny problems (e.g. googling “uppercase string java” may lead you to some sample code that you copy and paste into your solution). Such usages should be cited as comments in your hw, lab, and especially project code! Permitted with Extreme Caution: ● Looking at someone else’s project code to assist with debugging. Typing or dictacting code into someone else’s computer is a violation of the “By You Alone” rule. ● Looking at someone else’s project code to understand a particular idea or part of a project. This is strongly discouraged due to the danger of plagiarism, but not absolutely forbidden. We are very serious about the “By You Alone” rule! ● Working on a project alongside another person or group of people. Your code should not substantially resemble anyone else’s! Absolutely Forbidden: ● Possessing another student’s project code in any form before a final deadline, be it electronic or on paper. This includes the situation where you’re trying to help someone debug. Distributing such code is equally forbidden. ● Possessing project solution code that you did not write yourself (from online (e.g. GitHub), staff solution code found somewhere on a server it should not have been, etc.) before a final deadline. Distributing such code is equally forbidden. ● Posting solution code to any assignment in a public place (e.g. a public git repository, mediafire, etched into stones above the Mediterranean, etc). This applies even after the semester is over. ● Working in lock-step with other students. Your workflow should not involve a group of people identifying, tackling, and effectively identically solving a sequence of subproblems. We have advanced cheating detection software, and we will routinely run this code to detect cheating. Every semester, we catch and penalize a significant number of people (roughly 100 cases per semester). Do not be one of them. If you find yourself at such a point of total desperation that cheating begins to look attractive, contact one of the instructors and we can maybe help somehow. Likewise, if 61B is causing massive disruption to your personal life, please contact us directly. If you admit guilt to an act of plagiarism before we catch you, you will be given zero points on that assignment, and we will not refer your case to the university administration. Obviously, the expressive power of Java is a subset of the English language. And yes, you can obviously obey the letter of this entire policy while completely violating its spirit. However, this policy is not a game to be defeated, and such circumventions will be seen as plagiarism. Lateness The expected deadlines for each assignment are posted on the class website. Our assumption is that you will complete each assignment by its due date. However, we understand that life gets in the way, and especially with the Coronavirus, unexpected circumstances may arise. It is possible to submit work late by requesting an “extension token” for the assignment using the Extension tab on Beacon . You can find the full instructions on submitting extensions on the Beacon guide . The system will grant an extension token as long as: 1. You have not used up your slip time. 2. The extension is for less than 72 hours. Every student will starts with a total of 6 days worth of slip time that can be used on labs or projects (including extra credit assignments). In order for us to release the solutions to conceptual homework assignments on time, you may not use any slip days on homework. For example, consider a student who has: 1. Submitted HW2 3 hours late. 2. Submitted Project 2 35 hours late. 3. Submitted Lab 7 16 hours late. 4. Realizes four days after the deadline that they forgot to submit Project 2. This student has used 2.25 of their slip days and they have 3.75 remaining. This student will be unable to submit project 2, because it is already more than 3 days late, and will therefore receive a score of zero on project 2. Slip days are intended to cover life events and disability accomodations. Students who have dire life circumstances that require additional time beyond the 6 slip days should email our staff email account (cs61b@berkeley.edu) if their supply becomes too low, and additional slip days may be granted if appropriate. You can request an extension for the extra credit portions of the different projects, if available. They usually appear at the end of every project spec. However, you cannot request extensions on project checkpoints. These are special graders that allow you to submit a subset of the assignment early (more detalis on each project’s spec). Similarly, you can get extra credit for submitting Project 0 a day early, and will not be able to request an extension for this opportunity. Additionally, you will not be able to request extensions for homework assignments or Project 3 Part B. Finally, you will be able to use a maximum of 2 slip days on Project 1. Note that while you can submit assignments late under these rules, staff will not provide help with an assignment passed its deadline. Thus, all Ed posts, Gitbugs, and Office Hours tickets concerning a past-due assignment will be ignored. Auditing CS61B This is for students who are unofficially auditing this class. Maybe you are a non-Berkeley student who wants to brush up on your programming knowledge or even a high school student who wants to get a head start on your programming career. You can follow along with our lectures and assignments, getting all the code from our skeleton as described in lab 1. The only difference is that you won’t have a CS61B GitHub repository, you’ll have to make your own. We also have an autograder on Gradescope set up just for you! The Gradescope course activation code is P5WVGW. We’ll release the autograder for assignments about 3 days after it is due for Berkeley students.

The CS61B requirement can be bypassed if you have solidexperience with a C-based programming language.TextbookWe will be using the \u0000rst edition of Patterson and Hennessy’s Computer Organization andDesign RISC-V Edition book (“P&H”), ISBN 0128122757. We are also requiring The CProgramming Language, Second Edition by Kernighan and Ritchie (“K&R”), and will reference itssections in the reading assignments. Other books are also suitable if you are alreadycomfortable with them, but our lectures will be based on K&R. Finally, we will be using TheDatacenter as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines(“WSC”), which is freely available online here.Teaching Plan(thanks to John DeNero and the CS61A team, as well as Kara Nelson of the College ofEngineering for their version that this document was based on)In Spring 2021, CS61C is planning to try a new teaching plan to better support students andencourage participation during this unusual online o\u0000ering of the course.Guiding Principles Moving OnlineCollaboration, not competition: You are encouraged to form study groups and work togetherto understand course material, but (unless speci\u0000ed otherwise) all your graded work should becompleted on your own. For example, in discussing how to solve a project you are encouragedto discuss high level strategies but you should not share code. Academic integrity and ethicalconduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, especiallywith online o\u0000erings. We want to remind you that this course is absolute graded – that meansthat there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you don’t have to feel the pressure ofhaving to cheat to get your A. You’re competing against an absolute scale, and you can all (intheory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make small bin adjustments if the GPA ofthe class is below the department suggested range, so we might adjust your score up, but it’llnever be adjusted down)In particular we are going to start by creating study groups of 4 using Prof. Ranade’s studygroup creating tool. This tool is designed to create e\u0000ective groups of students and was usedsuccessfully in 16A last semester. Although participation in the group creation is optional, youare strongly encouraged to participate as this has proven to be a highly e\u0000ective tool in creatingdurable study groups even in the remote context.Flexibility, Community: Online classes taught during a time of wild\u0000res, power outages, and aworldwide pandemic need to have policies that support students in di\u0000erent living situations,and in di\u0000erent time zones. They need to have a way that the students can get to know eachother, learn from each other, and study with each other. They need to have a way the coursesta\u0000 can get to know their students, and (most importantly) check in with them to make suretheir health and learning is going ok. The deadlines need to have \u0000exibility in case a student orteam needs some more time to \u0000nish a project or homework. We believe we have built all ofthat into our class this semester.Here’s the overall summary of all the elements of the course: Spring 2021 OnlineO\u0000cial Academic Guidecourse description.Exams“Clobber” PolicyO\u0000ce HoursComputer ResourcesGradingDeadlinesEPA (TBD)LecturesDiscussionsLabsCheck-inHomeworkProjectsAcademic Dishonesty andCheatingDisabled Students’ ProgramAccommodations andExtensionsExtenuating Circumstancesand InclusivenessCampus Student Services 2/10 Spring 2021 OnlineLectureTuTh lecture for an hour and a half. Clicker questions after every lecture, whichearn credit. These are due 48 hours after the lecture is given. If you choose towatch lectures asynchronously, we strongly recommend scheduling a time in yourcalendar every week for watching the lecture to help you stay on track.LabYou and your partner do them together (in your own zoom rooms) or in Lab OH.You will EACH then submit the completed lab to the autograder to get full credit.We are not having checko\u0000s. Instead, we will be having checkin’s about once amonth. More will be explained below.Checkin’sThis semester, we will have two check-ins. These will be 8 minute sections whereyou will meet with a TA to discuss anything you want. You can even use it as o\u0000cehours. You must attend it as it is worth separate course credit. More will beexplained below.DiscussionFour live 1-hour discussions spread out through Thursday, Friday, and Monday.These videos are saved and shared. A pre-recorded “archival-quality” discussion ofTAs going over the worksheet is also available. All four will cover the same materialand the same worksheets. Attendance is not taken.O\u0000ceHoursTAs and faculty will hold o\u0000ce hours on Zoom. We will have 3 types of o\u0000ce hours:Lab OH for lab questions, Project OH for project questions, and Regular OH foranything else. Please note that a TA can help you at anything at any of the o\u0000cehours though unrelated questions will not have priority. Faculty add 1-on-1appointment slots.ProjectO\u0000ceHoursWe will have additional o\u0000ce hours spread out closer to the due dates of theprojects. They will be held via Zoom.ExamsMidterm: 2 hours Final: 3 hours All exams occur over a set period of time. Open book, open note, closed internet.We will be proctoring based on this.ExamsThere will be one midterm, and one \u0000nal exam, delivered through the Examtool system.Midterm: 3/17 9:00AM-11:00AM PT. Covers up to and including the 3/4 lecture onPipelining.Final: 5/13 8:00AM-11:00AM PT. All topics are in scope and are equally emphasised.Exams are open book, open note, closed internet, no collaboration of any kind. Note that youmay not use Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google slides or similar platforms. You may downloadthem instead. We will be proctoring based on this. (We will update this link once we have\u0000nalized our exam policies). Collaboration on exams will result in an immediate F in the course!“Clobber” PolicyThere is no clobber policy this semester.O\u0000ce HoursWe hope you take advantage of the ample o\u0000ce hours we have scheduled this term. Whencoming to o\u0000ce hours for lab or project help, there are some policies you’ll need to abide by.In order to reduce queue wait times, help will be limited to 10 minutes. If this is not su\u0000cient,please rejoin the queue. This is designed to make the queuing time both signi\u0000cantly shorterand more predictable.TAs will not be debugging code endlessly without reason. This is not a good learning practice,they have limited time, and part of the goal of this course is to turn you into a great tester anddebugger.Therefore, before coming to o\u0000ce hours, students should have done the following on the hivemachines:Run valgrind and \u0000xed all memory leaks/warningsWritten a test that isolates/demonstrates their issue (NOT just a sta\u0000-provided test) 3/10Stepped through the test with (c)gdb to \u0000nd the line number the issue occurs onThere are instructions for testing on all project specs, and you can review how to run valgrindand (c)gdb in lab.When a TA takes your ticket, they will ask you to show that you do not have any compilerwarnings or memory leaks. Please ensure that you have this pulled up so that you can show theTA quickly. If you have compiler warnings or memory leaks, the TA will not be able to assist youuntil this is \u0000xed (unless your question is about how to \u0000x the compiler warnings or memoryleaks).Before joining the queue, you must add the following to your problem description in order tohelp the TA better understand what you need help with and to ensure that you have attemptedto debug your code before coming to o\u0000ce hours.If your question is conceptual/homework/lab (non-debugging), \u0000ll in the prompt below: Detailedquestion:If your question is project/lab (debugging), \u0000ll in the prompt below: Have you \u0000xed all compilerwarnings? Have you run valgrind and \u0000xed all memory leaks? Detailed question: Steps have youtaken to solve this problem:If you do not \u0000ll out the description properly, your ticket will be resolved. Descriptions like“please help”, “I don’t understand how to do this problem”, etc are not su\u0000cient and will beresolved. Examples of good descriptions:conceptual/homework/lab (non-debugging): Detailed question: I am having a hard timeunderstanding when you should use malloc(). I understand that malloc will store data on theheap, and that this data will remain allocated until you call free(), but I don’t understand whenyou should allocate data using malloc() vs when you should allocate data on the stack.Debugging: Have you \u0000xed all compiler warnings? yes Have you run valgrind and \u0000xed allmemory leaks? yes Detailed question: I am getting a segfault in my code for Project X. I havedetermined that it is occuring in the function example_func(). I have also \u0000gured out that it onlyhappens when the parameter example_param is greater than 16. Steps have you taken to solvethis problem: I have run my code through gdb which helped me determine that the error isoccurring in example_func() when example_param() is greater than 16. The segfault is occurringon line 57 when I try to access an element in the example_array.Since our o\u0000ce hours will be in open zoom rooms, you MUST be in the Zoom room if you areon the queue. If we get to your name and you are not in the zoom call, we will skip you and youwill have to sign up again.We have 3 di\u0000erent types of o\u0000ce hours: Normal OH (includes Head TA and Instructor OH), LabOH, and Project OH. Each of them has a priority of types of questions which they will answer.Normal OH will prioritize homework, exam, and conceptual questions. It then will take projectquestions, and \u0000nally take lab questions last. Lab OH will take lab questions \u0000rst but also takeany other type of question if there are no lab questions. Project OH will take project questions\u0000rst, then homework, exam, and conceptual questions next. It will \u0000nally take Lab questionslast.Computer ResourcesNOTE: To access our resources from di\u0000erent places around the world, please download anduse the campus VPN: https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/using-the-libraries/vpn.Discussion ForumAll important course announcements will be made on Piazza. We will be automatically enrollingeveryone and locking piazza enrollment: https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2021/cs61c. Wehave decided to no longer allow for non-enrolled students to join our Piazza. We decided thisbecause we do not have enough bandwidth to answer questions from students who are notenrolled in the course.Piazza EtiquetteSearch before posting: Sometimes your question may have already been answered by usor other students in the past. This gives us more time to answer new questions. Also you 4/10will avoid having us link to another post as an answer.Link and screenshot any external resources you are referring to (exams, discussion,stackover\u0000ow, lecture slides + webcast time/video): It is more convenient for us andother students to look at the screenshot and follow the link if we need more context onthe question. It will also substantially decrease the time it takes for us to answer yourquestion.Try to avoid too open-ended/vague questions such as: “How does C work?” or “Howcome the solution to a discussion problem is this?” or “How does this proof from thetextbook work?” It is very di\u0000cult for us to know how to help you when we are asked thesequestions. If you walk us through your thoughts and reference speci\u0000c lines that you \u0000ndconfusing, we can better address the problem you are facing. It may even help us uncoverany misunderstandings that you may have.Please try to post project/homework questions publicly as follow-ups on theappropriate question threads whenever possible. If your question is toodetailed/revealing to \u0000t there, that’s a sign that your question is better answered duringo\u0000ce hours. We do not have the bandwidth to pre-grade/debug solutions on Piazza, sodetailed private homework/project questions are discouraged.You should only post in the “Student Answer” box if you are fairly certain aboutyour answer. Do not post follow up questions or +1 in the student answer. Posting in the“Student Answer” section marks a post as resolved and will likely be missed. Use “Followups” to follow up while leaving the overall post unresolved.You should NOT follow up with +1’s to a post you agree/like! Instead, you should usethe helpful button on a question/followup. We do not allow +1’s because they clutter thepost and make it more di\u0000cult to get to the unresolved follow-ups.If you want a reply on a follow up, mark it as unresolved, or we may not see it.If you reply to a follow up answering the question at hand, mark the follow up asresolved since it no longer requires attention.If you don’t understand the given responses to your question, come to OH and markyour question as a conceptual question when putting yourself on the queue.Conceptual questions, which are questions on discussions, past homeworks, concepts (iefrom the textbook or lectures) and this semester’s exams get priority over homework orproject questions. It is sometimes much easier to explain questions in a one on onesetting where sta\u0000 can articulate their points through illustrations.Excessive spam will result in a ban for at least a day! While we are here to help youlearn, we are not the only tool you should use! If we \u0000nd you posting a lot of excessiveposts/followups asking for someone to answer a di\u0000erent post in a short period of time,we will ban you. Also if you have a question, try to think on it for an hour and use yourother resources: the textbook, Google, Stackover\u0000ow, etc to see if someone has alreadyanswered the question you had. Also feel free to come to o\u0000ce hours!Anonymous Posting Keep in mind that, if you are posting anonymously, you can’t editposts, so be careful before clicking the Submit button. Please avoid long chains of 1-2sentence follow ups; it unnecessarily extends the thread and makes it much harder tofollow people’s thought processes and \u0000nd questions that need answers. These may beremoved so it is easier to \u0000nd questions and answer those questions.Computer AccountsYou will need a CS61C class account for use in the computer labs, submitting assignments, andtracking your grades. You must request a class login via https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct.Make sure you remember your log-in information once you change it! We cannot recoveryour account information for you. If you are unable to request an account due to concurrentenrollment status, please follow the instructions in lab 0. If you are a late add, you may use anyother class account, or your CS199 account until the option to create an inst account for CS61Cis available to you. Note: The CS61C sta\u0000 does not have any control over how quicklyconcurrent enrollment/late add accounts are processed.Computer LabsYou can connect remotely to the lab computers using the following addresses:330 Soda (“The Hive” – Linux)If the Hive machine you have chosen is running too slow, try another one. You can \u0000nd a list ofthe available Hive machines and their current workloads here: 5/10HivemindGradingIn order to foster a collaborative environment, CS61C is initially graded on a \u0000xed scale. Thecourse is graded out of 300 points, with the following mappings from points to letter grades:Raw ScoreGrade290+A+[270,290)A[260,270)A-[250,260)B+[230,250)B[220,230)B-[210,220)C+[190,210)C[180,190)C-[140,180)D[0,140)FIn the event that our distribution does not align with the EECS departmental guidelines, we maydecrease the raw score boundaries, but they will not increase (i.e. it is possible to receive ahigher grade than the mapping suggests, but not a lower one). Please note that we will notinclude PNP students or Incompletes in any adjustments we do.We will compute grades from a weighted average, as follows:AssignmentPercentage of GradeLecture3% (9 points)Labs10% (30 points)Checkin’s (2 total)1% (3 points)Homework11% (33 points)Project 111% (33 points)Project 211% (33 points)Project 311% (33 points)Project 411% (33 points)Midterm11% (33 points)Final20% (60 points)Below, you will \u0000nd sections describing some of these assignment types.DeadlinesAny assignment which is due by the end of the day is due by 11:00.00PM! Even if you submit asecond late (aka 11:00.01PM), it will be considered one day late!EPA (TBD)EPA was created to encourage people to be good academic citizens, in a way that traditionalgrades could not capture. This can help boost you over a grade boundary if you’re close to one.Scoring is con\u0000dential (we’ll never tell you your EPA score and you shouldn’t ask), and isdecided by the teaching sta\u0000, so make sure they know your name.Here are the categories:E\u0000ort = {O\u0000ce hours, doing every single lab, hw, reading Piazza pages, etc.}Participation = {Raising hand in discussion, asking Piazza questions, etc.}Altruism = {Helping other students in lab, answering Piazza or O\u0000ce Hrs questions}Lectures 6/10Lectures are synchronous and recorded and formally start on Berkeley time, so Tuesdayand Thursday 11:10 AM and last until 12:29PM. You are encouraged to attend thesynchronous lecture as you can use the Zoom chat to answer questions. If however youwould rather watch the lecture recorded you can do so. We will also provide the Fall 2020lectures (which are broken into signi\u0000cantly smaller pieces) for those who prefer thatformat for lectures.The recorded lectures (both for the current semester and Fall 2020) will be posted onKaltura. We will ensure that any administrative announcements in the synchronouslectures will be in the beginning and posted on piazza.We have observed that students who stay current with lectures tend to perform better inthe class. Thus after the scheduled end of the synchronous lecture you will have 48 hoursto complete a short Gradescope quiz on the lecture content.Finally, the lecture zoom room will be started 20 minutes before the start time at 10:50AM.This open time can be used to ask questions of the instructors. This is also formally knownas “Pet Time”. Students are encouraged to bring their own dogs, cats, ferrets, snakes,gerbils, or other pets. Any student who wants can then ask to be added to the video panelbefore the start of lecture so that everyone can enjoy your pets.DiscussionsThe purpose of discussion is to solidify student understanding of the material through guidedproblem solving. With an online course, some people \u0000nd it helpful to be in the room with a TAwhen they go over the problems, so we will have two discussion sections on Zoom spread outthroughout the day (with one additional section on Friday and another on Monday), and we willrecord the sessions for those who normally attend but can’t make it. In addition, we’ll have apre-recorded “archival-quality” discussion of TAs going over the worksheet available. All four willcover the same material and the same worksheets.LabsLabs are designed to give you introductory experience with the course material. It is stronglyrecommended to have a partner to complete the labs; if you don’t know anyone in class, youcan use Piazza to \u0000nd a partner. (If the partnership turns out not to work, you can alwaysdisband the partnership after a lab and \u0000nd another partner, there will probably be a fairamount of “churn” the \u0000rst few weeks.) You’d then work on the lab together with your partner(we’ve found that pair programming works great; one partner sharing their screen as “driver”,while the other partner serves as “navigator” – then you switch roles every 30m or so). You areNOT required to have a lab partner.Labs are graded on correct completion. Completion of all labs is highly recommended forsuccess in the course. Each of the labs are graded out of 2 points. Please note that these arenot 2 points each from the 33 points “Labs” portion in your course grade. Each lab is simplygraded out of 2 points, and we will scale the lab total to the 33 points course grade portion.For full credit, labs must submit to the lab autograder by the stated deadlines, which are Friday11PM PT, for the lab of the week. If you submit to the lab autograder within a week after theoriginal deadline, you will be able to receive half credit (1 point) at most (Note that Gradescopewill still show this as 2 points though Total Course Points will handle the late time). Anytimeafter that, you will not be able to get any credit, and the lab autograder will no longer beaccepting submissions. Please make sure to always activate the correct submission if youchoose to resubmit otherwise you will not get credit for the lab. We will NOT change youractive submission if it is wrong!We will be giving you one lab drop which will drop your lowest lab score. If you are working witha partner, BOTH you and your partner are expected to submit your own code to the labautograder. If one of you fails to do so, the person who did not submit will NOT get credit or thelab. The lab that you drop does not need to be the same lab that your partner drops.The sta\u0000 recommends always asking for help in lab o\u0000ce hours when you need it. Each lab willcontain questions you should be able to answer. Some of the questions have a Gradescopeautograder while other questions may not be required for points. You should still answer all ofthem to bene\u0000t your learning. The purpose of this is to gauge your understanding and \u0000ll in anyholes/build on your knowledge of the concepts assessed by the lab questions. If you are unsureof the answer to any of these questions you should ask for help. 7/10Check-inWe will have check-ins twice during this semester. We will send out an announcement when tosign up for check-ins. You will have one week to sign up and the checkins themselves will bespread out over three weeks. If you fail to sign up for a slot, you will be automatically assignedone. You may sign up for a check-in with any TA you’d like. You will be required to attend to getcredit. You may ask any questions you have. You can even use it as an 8 minute o\u0000ce hourswindow. If you have any personal questions, feel free to ask in your check-in!HomeworkHomework is designed to give you more problem practice on the week’s material. Weencourage you to work on the homework problems in small groups, but each student isrequired to turn in a solution that they have written themselves.Homework is done online via gradescope and is graded on correctness. Once again,completion of all HW is highly recommended.We will release homework solutions shortly after the [late] due date, so late homework is notaccepted. There are no homework drops. We will give 3 slip days just for homeworks whichmay be used on any homework without prior approval. Since we want to release homeworksolutions as soon as we can, the latest you can turn homework in up to 3 days after the duedate.Homeworks will give you unlimited attempts.ProjectsProjects are designed to give you heavy-duty experience with the application of course content.Projects are graded on correctness.You will work on ALL projects individually All of these projects were designed to be completableon your own. Collaborating with other students is strictly prohibited. Please see the section onAcademic Dishonesty below.For each day that a project is late, 1/3 of your earned points on the project are deducted, untilthe project is worth nothing. Lateness rounds up to the nearest day - that is, an assignment thatis 2 hours late is one day late. Please note that projects have a hard deadline of 1 weekafter it is due. Even if you had a 5 day extension, you would only be able to use up to two ofyour slip days on it even if you had three.Projects are di\u0000cult, so don’t worry if you don’t get 100% on projects! We also have aphilosophy on autograders: we only provide visible sanity tests. So there will be immediatefeedback that your code compiles and runs on a simple test case but you won’t be able to seethe results of the tests that are used to determine your grade. Additionally, you should ensureyou have set the submission you want to use as your \u0000nal grade as your ‘active’ submission.You may change your ‘active’ submission up until the late due date. We will not change yourproject submission after the late due date passes regardless of if you did better onanother submission. We do not want you to use the autograder as an oracle since much ofprogramming is actually testing your code.Slip DaysTo help you handle any issues that arise, we give you three project slip-day tokens and threehomework slip-day tokens, which allow you to reduce your late penalties on late project andhomework submissions respectively. There are no slip days for any other assignment. You mayuse all slip days on a single assignment.Example usages:Use two slip-days to receive no penalty on a project submitted two days lateUse two slip-days to receive no penalty for two separate projects each submitted one daylateUse three slip-days to receive just a 1/3 penalty on a project submitted 4 days lateWe will track the total number of late days for your submissions and automatically applythem to optimize their usage. 8/10Slip-days may only be applied towards their speci\u0000c category, and not any otherassignments. Slip-days will not be assessed against assignments you did not submit. Noextra credit is awarded for avoiding the use of slip-days, however it is in your best interestto avoid turning assignments in late. Usually, a new project will be released very shortlyafter the current project is due.Slip days are in terms of “days” meaning a project submitted one minute after thedeadline consumes one entire token. Please plan accordingly as there is no grace periodfor slip days or extensions.Academic Dishonesty and CheatingBerkeley honor code: Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to this code: “As a member ofthe UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”Please carefully read the policies below and ask a member of the course sta\u0000 if you have anyquestions or if something is unclear.All work that is to be done INDIVIDUALLY should be YOUR work and your work ALONE.All partner work should be done by you and your partner ALONE (no discussing or sharingsolutions or algorithmic approaches with other students)You are encouraged to help each other debug without viewing each other’s code or talkingspeci\u0000cally about algorithms. Beyond that, we don’t want you sharing approaches, ideas,code or whiteboarding with other students.It is NOT acceptable to copy solutions from other students.It is NOT acceptable to copy (or start your) solutions from the Web.It is NOT acceptable to leave your code anywhere where an unscrupulous student could\u0000nd and steal it (e.g., public GITHUBs, walking away while leaving yourself logged on,leaving printouts lying around, etc.)We have tools and methods, developed over many years, for detecting this. You WILL becaught, and the penalties WILL be severe. This software can even detect attempts topurposefully obfuscate copying. If you have questions whether a behavior is crossing theline, ask! You can read some of the testimonials of students who were caught cheatingwhich Josh Hug collected here: https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/guides/incident-reports-2017.html.At the minimum negative points will be given for the assignment (meaning you’re bettero\u0000 NOT submitting anything than cheating), and a letter in your Cal record documentingthe cheating. Penalties can be greater, including an F in the class.Both the giver and the receiver of code are equally culpable and su\u0000er equal penalties.Disabled Students’ ProgramThe Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) is committed to ensuring that all students withdisabilities have equal access to educational opportunities at UC Berkeley. They o\u0000er a widerange of services for students with disabilities that are individually designed and remove theneed to reveal sensitive medical information to the course sta\u0000. If you have a medical need forextensions of exam times or assignment deadlines, these will be granted through o\u0000cialdocumentation from DSP. Please start the process at https://dsp.berkeley.edu as soon aspossible to avoid delays.If you already have documentation from DSP, please ensure its been submitted on the SCARABportal so that instructors have access to your accommodations. Please do not email it or post iton Piazza!If you’d like to request an extension in line with your DSP status, please use the form linkedhere. If your request falls under the accommodations stated in your letter it will beautomatically granted, otherwise it will be submitted to the instructors for additional review.Even if your letter has the accommodations, you must still \u0000ll out this form otherwise you willnot be granted the extension. We will not be granting extensions if you do NOT request themregardless of if it is in your letter!Accommodations and Extensions 9/10If you are a non-DSP student interested in requesting an extension or accommodation for anassignment, you can do so by \u0000lling out the form linked here. Note that this form will notautomatically grant any extensions; they will be logged and submitted to the instructors foradditional review.We do NOT give extensions for late adding the class. If you have any intention of taking theclass but are not enrolled in the class, you must enroll the class (at least being on the waitlist)and you must keep up with the work.Extenuating Circumstances and InclusivenessInclusion: We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students thatsupports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and respects your identitiesand backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class,sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a nameand/or set of pronouns that di\u0000er from those that appear in your o\u0000cial records, please let usknow. If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiencesoutside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk withus. We want to be resources for you. As a participant in this class, recognize that you can beproactive about making other students feel included and respected. For example, this meanswhen you encounter someone who doesn’t know something, rather than replying with shockedincredulity “What?! You don’t know that?!”, you can e\u0000use with “Awesome, I get to teach you!”.https://xkcd.com/1053/ We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and canhave widely-varying circumstances a\u0000ect them during their time in the course. If you have anyunforeseen circumstances that arise during the course, please do not hesitate to contact theinstructors in o\u0000ce hours or via e-mail or private Piazza post to discuss your situation. Thesooner we are made aware, the more easily these situations can be resolved. Extenuatingcircumstances include work-school balance, familial responsibilities, religious observations,military duties, unexpected travel, or anything else beyond your control that may negativelyimpact your performance in the class. We (like many people) are still in the process of learningabout diverse perspectives and identities. If something is said in class (by anyone) that makesyou feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by a sta\u0000 member or fellow student, pleasereport the incident to our instructors, head TA, or another member of sta\u0000 you’re comfortablewith so that we may address the issue and maintain a supportive and inclusive learningenvironment.

Regardless, please read all of the following policies carefully. Technology Piazza We will use Piazza as the 'one-stop shop' throughout the semester: for a Q&A forum and for official announcements. Enrollment in Piazza is mandatory. If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructors or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. See the Piazza Etiquette  section for more on using Piazza. To join the class on Piazza, follow this link. Gradescope All homework will be submitted through Gradescope, and all homework and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. If you have not been enrolled in our Gradescope, please fill out this Google Form Email Please use Piazza for all technical questions, and also all administrative questions about the course that are not personal to you: other students may also benefit from seeing the answers to these questions. If you have a more specific administrative question that relates to you alone, please either use a private post on Piazza (visible to course staff only) or send email to the course administrative account sp20@eecs70.org (read by instructors and head TAs only). Instructional Servers CS 70 does not make use of instructional accounts, but to get a computer account for this course, go to http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct , or click 'WebAcct' on http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu . Exams The Midterms are tentatively scheduled as follows: Midterm 1 is on Tuesday, March 3 from 8-10pm. Midterm 2 is on Tuesday, April 7 from 8-10pm. The Final is on Thursday, May 14 from 3-6pm. Unfortunately, due to large enrollment, we are unable to accommodate final exam conflicts ; we strongly discourage enrollment in another class with conflicting lectures and/or final exam; if you choose to enroll in such a class you will have to make arrangements for an alternate Final with the other class. Midterm conflicts will be accommodated only if the conflict is with another campus exam or comparable activity. You must fill out a form (available on Piazza) to request such an accommodation, at least two weeks in advance. Exam Clobber Policy This course spans a fairly broad set of ideas and concepts within a short period of time, and hence sustained and consistent effort and investment are critical to your success in this class. Similarly, by far the most common operating mode we have observed in previous students who struggled and/or failed this class was attempting to do the bare minimum in general and then catch up/cram right before the exams. In order to formally encourage all of you to maintain the sustained effort that we have observed to be critical to success, we will be adopting a new policy regarding exam clobbering, participation, and effort. Specifically, for students who (1) complete an optional midterm redo and (2) perform significantly better on the final exam, we will provide the opportunity to clobber a midterm. If you qualify for the clobber (i.e. (1) and (2)), you may replace your lowest midterm score with your scaled score on the final exam according to the formula below. Replacement MT score (on scale of 100) = max [MT score, final exam score - 15% (on scale of 100)] This essentially allows you to replace your midterm grade by a higher grade --- we want to reward improved performance. If you complete the optional midterm redo for both midterms, and are eligible for a clobber on both midterm, the clobber that helps your score more is applied (i.e. you may clobber either Midterm 1 or Midterm 2, but not both, and only if you complete both midterm redos). Please note that even though lecture attendance is not included (for logistical reasons) in the two criteria for clobbering eligibility, we do strongly encourage you to attend lecture in person. Exam Attendance Policy You must attend at least two of the three exams (Midterm 1, Midterm 2, Final Exam) in order to pass the class. We will consider granting an incomplete given extenuating circumstances. Simply not attending the final exam does not ensure an automatic failure. Materials All materials can be found on the front page . Notes There is no textbook for this class. Instead, there is a set of comprehensive lecture notes. Make sure you revisit the notes after every lecture, and multiple times thereafter: you should be aware that it will likely take several readings before you fully understand the material.  Each note may be covered in one or more lectures. Note 0 is background material that you should make sure you understand before the first lecture. Discussions Release Schedule: Discussion solutions are published after all sections are completed. The discussion sections are designed not to cover new material but to consolidate the material covered in lectures and in the notes. It is highly recommended that you attend both discussions each week. You may attend any discussion section, but we recommend that you settle on a weekly two-section pair (with the same TA) as early as possible in the semester. Some section times are more popular than others: if a particular section is too full, then students will be admitted on a first-come first- served basis and others will have to attend an alternative section. It is in your own interests to find a section that is not over-subscribed.  All sections are equivalent: they all cover the same material. Each week, the Tuesday/Wedensday sections will cover the preceding Tuesday lecture, while the Thursday/Friday sections will cover the corresponding Thursday lecture. Homeworks Release Schedule: Homework for the coming week is released on Monday by noon. Homework is due on Gradescope the following Friday at 11:59 p.m., with a grace period until Sunday at 11:59 p.m.; the solutions for that homework will be released the following Monday. Self-grades and resubmissions will be due Wednesday immediately following this, at 11:59 p.m. There will be weekly required homeworks designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. Maximum credit for each homework will be given for any score of 75% or more . Your lowest two homework scores will be dropped, but these drops should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed homeworks: please do not contact us about missed homeworks or late submissions. Homework Submission Homeworks are due on Friday night at 11:59 PM.  You need to turn in a .pdf file consisting of your written-up solutions; you may use your phone camera or any page- scanning app in order to turn your written homework into a PDF, as long as your work is clear and legible. In addition, Gradescope has an option to associate pages of your work to each homework problem. You must select the relevant pages for every problem. Any problems without pages selected will receive zero credit.  If you have any questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to office hours or homework party. Homework Grading - Self Grading The point of homework in this class is for you to learn the material. To help you in doing this each student will grade their own homework in addition to being graded by 70 readers. After the HW deadline, official solutions will be posted online. You will then be expected to read them and enter your own scores and comments for every part of every problem in the homework on a simple coarse scale:  0 Points: Didn't attempt or very very wrong  2 Points: Got started and made some progress, but went off in the wrong direction or with no clear direction  5 Points: Right direction and got half-way there  8 Points: Mostly right but a minor thing missing or wrong  10 Points: 100% correct Note: You must justify self-grades of 2, 5, or 8 with a comment. Grades of 0 and 10 do not need to be justified. If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on Piazza. This is not supposed to be a stressful process. Your self-grades will be due on the Wednesday following the homework deadline at 11:59 PM sharp. We will accept late self-grades up to a week after the original homework deadline for 65% credit on the associated homework assignment.  If you don't enter a proper grade by this deadline, you are giving yourself a zero on that assignment. Merely doing the homework is not enough, you must do the homework; turn it in on time; read the solutions; do the self-grade; and turn it in on time. Unless all of these steps are done, you will get a zero for that assignment. Course readers are going to be grading and sending you occasional comments. Because we have reader grades, we will catch any attempts at trying to inflate your own scores. This will be considered cheating and is definitely not worth the risk. Your own scores will be used in computing your final grade for the course, adjusted by taking into account reader scores so that everyone is fairly graded effectively on the same scale. For example, if we notice that you tend to give yourself 5s on questions where readers looking at your homeworks tend to give you 8s, we will apply an upward correction to adjust. Reader grades will be released on Gradescope about one week after the homework deadline. Readers grade questions either on a “coarse” or “fine” scale for each homework part. Coarsely graded question parts are worth a single point and are based on effort. Finely graded question parts are worth a total of 10 points and are graded using the same self-grading rubric above. Homework regrade requests are typically due on Gradescope within 72 hours of reader grades being released. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the homework, the grader reserves the right to regrade the entire homework and could potentially take points off. If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza. Homework Resubmission Again, the point of homework in this class is to help you learn. We understand that sometimes work from other classes, midterms or your personal life can come in the way of making a homework deadline. For this reason we will allow you to resubmit your homework for 50% credit. Homework resubmissions must be HANDWRITTEN. Homework resubmissions will be due along with the self-grades, so they will be due by 11:59pm Wednesday night. If you choose to resubmit your homework, you must submit two sets of self-grades, one for the first submission and one for the second submission. For the second submission do self-grades as normal. We will apply the 50% correction. What does 50% credit mean? Let us say you only were able to get halfway through a problem during the first submission. You submitted your homework on Friday, and while going through the solutions you figured out how to do the whole problem. Your self-grade for your first submission would be a 5/10. However, you can resubmit the homework problem with a fully correct solution and receive 50% of the remaining points as extra points, i.e. (10-5) * 50/100 = 2.5 extra points, and so your score for the problem would go from 5 points to 7.5 points. Cheating We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating. Consequences of cheating include: negative points for the corresponding assignment, a failing grade in the class, and/or a referral to the Office of Student Conduct. Collaboration You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study groups of two to five people; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own . Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim . We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group are types of interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize this material. At no time should you be in possession of another student's solution. You may discuss approaches but your solution must be written by you and you only. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. Not only is this good scholarly conduct, it also protects you from accusations of being a \"free-rider\" regarding your colleagues' ideas. Warning:  Your attention is drawn to the Department's Policy on Academic Dishonesty . In particular, you should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class (or any other source without acknowledgment) constitutes cheating. Any student found to be cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Grading This course is not graded on a curve. We will set absolute thresholds for performance that will map to grade boundaries. We encourage you to discuss the course material with each other and teach each other new ideas and concepts that you learn. Teaching the material is one of the best ways to learn, so discussing course material with colleagues in the class is a win-win situation for everyone. Grades are not everything, far from it, but that said, here is the breakdown for grading for this class:  Homework: 40 Points  Midterm 1: 65 Points  Midterm 2: 65 Points  Final: 130 Points Grade bins:  A: 90%  A-: 87%  B+: 80%  B: 69%  B-: 60%  C+: 55%  C: 50%  C-: 47%  D+: 46%  D: 44%  D-: 40% Piazza Etiquette Important Note: We will encourage more student participation on Piazza rather than answering right away, that is, we will wait until other students step up and answer questions. Of course, we will still provide clarifications on logistics, typos, subtle points, etc. We want to make sure that you are helping each other out, and having instructors give away the answers isn't the most beneficial for your education either. In order to make Piazza a better resource for everyone, we've outlined some guidelines for you to follow when posting your questions. Questions which follow these guidelines will have a higher chance of being answered! 1. Ask HW questions only in HW posts. We've created individual posts for each problem from homework. Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those posts only. Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole post to see if your question has been answered. 2. Don't post answers in Piazza. Please don't give away the answer on Piazza. You can explain things in a way that still lets other students figure out the essence of the problem on their own, but don't spoil the problem. For example, don't point to a useful YouTube link that works out essentially what the problem is asking about. 3. Try to make posts public. While not violating Rule 2, try to make your questions public, because others might have the same question and we don't need to answer them multiple times. 4. Piazza is not OH. 5 minute-test. If you think your questions may take more than 5 minutes to answer, please come to office hours or homework parties instead. 5. Neither Piazza nor TAs are for pre-grading. Please do not post questions of the form:  \"Is this the correct solution to HW X problem Y?\"  \"Would this receive full credit on HW X problem Y?\"  \"Is this the right level of detail for HW X problem Y?\" Please do not use Piazza as a medium to ask instructors to check your homework in advance. We simply cannot check every student's homework through Piazza. Feel free to ask questions of clarification, or ask questions about the course content to achieve a deeper understanding, but at a certain point, you must apply your knowledge, give it your best shot, and submit your answers with confidence. 6. Post a screen shot of any resource referenced. Your question should be self-contained. The TAs (and other responders) should not have to scan through PDFs to even figure out what the question is. Ask yourself: am I referring to some lecture slide/lecture note/HW solution/discussion solution/past exam? If the answer is yes, post a screen shot of the relevant part. 7. Post all your work. Don't post one line saying: At step n, I get XYZ, and I'm now confused. This forces the TAs to guess: What happened in steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1? Most likely, the TAs will guess wrong, and we run into a mess of followup questions trying to figure out what steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1 were. Instead, post: Starting out, we have: .... Then, I do ..., and I get ... Next, I do ..., and I get ... Next, I do ..., and I get ... Now, I get $&%&#(, and this makes no sense. Then, the TA can respond: The mistake is at step 3, you're not allowed to apply ABC to XYZ because ... 8. Post narrow, precise questions. Questions of the form \"Can someone please explain stable marriage to me?\" are not helpful. There's an entire lecture note written on it. There are multiple parts to stable marriage:  actual algorithm  proof of termination  proof of stability  proof that it's male optimal  proof that it's female pessimal No TA is arrogant enough to think they can rewrite the lecture better than notes that have evolved over decades of teaching. Instead, the question should be precise, like: Title: Can someone please explain this step of the proof of stability? Body: [Image of Stable Marriage Algorithm] [Image of Proof of Stability (with an arrow draw in)] In the proof of stability, I get that we have:  fact 1 in your own words  fact 2 in your own words  fact 3 in your own words However, I don't get how we get:  fact 4 in your own words Survival Tips for CS 70 These tips have been collected through the years from professors, past and present. You can also check out the Learning How To Learn  Coursera for other general tips. Don't fall behind. In a conceptual class such as this, it is particularly important to maintain a steady effort throughout the semester, rather than hope to cram just before homework deadlines or exams. This is because it takes time and practice for the ideas to sink in. Make sure you allocate a sufficient number of hours every week to the class, including enough time for reading and understanding the material as well as for doing assignments. (As a rough guide, you should expect to do at least one hour of reading and two hours of problem solving for each hour of lecture.) Even though this class does not have any major projects, you should plan to spend as much time on it as on any of your other technical classes. Read the lecture notes before lecture. The material takes some time to sink in. You'll be able to pick up the nuances if you've already got a gist of what will be covered. Take the homeworks seriously. The homeworks are explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. Although the numerical weight of the homeworks is not huge, we work hard to make them instructive and interesting. Do read the sample solutions, even for the problems on which you received full points. You may well learn a different way of looking at the problem, and you may also benefit from emulating the style of the solutions. (In science, people learn a lot from emulating the approach of more experienced scientists.) Don't procrastinate on homework. Our best advice is to read through the homework problems as soon as they are available, and let them percolate in your brain. Think through possible approaches while you are waiting in line, or stuck in an elevator. Sleeping on a problem, or taking a walk has often helped people to come up with a creative approach to it. Definitely do not wait until the night before it is due to start working on the homework. Make use of office hours. The instructors and TAs hold office hours expressly to help you. It is often surprising how many students do not take advantage of this service. You are free to attend as many office hours as you wish (you are not constrained just to use the office hours of your section TA). You will also likely get more out of an office hour if you have spent a little time in advance thinking about the questions you have, and formulating them precisely. (In fact, this process can often lead you to a solution yourself!) Take part in discussion sections. Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning, through guided group problem solving and other activities. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to get out of it. Form study groups and/or come to homework parties. As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. And recall the caveat above that you must write up your solutions on your own. Homework parties are an alternative vehicle for working with others in a nice atmosphere, and can be a good place to find a group to work with regularly. Pay attention in lectures. As the semester proceeds, many of you will no doubt feel the urge to 'daydream' during lectures, or to skip them altogether, on the grounds that you can catch up by reading the lecture notes. If you follow this strategy, you should be aware that reading mathematics is NOT the same as reading a novel or a news article: each page of mathematics needs to be read many times before it is fully understood, and needs to be backed up by examples and discussion. Following the material in class should save you several readings; even just watching it go by without fully understanding it makes your later reading easier. And you also get the benefit of student questions, examples etc. Exactly how you handle lectures is up to you. One strategy is to print out the lecture notes in advance, bring them to lecture, and add a few additional notes during class."

The grade breakdown is given below, but a failure to complete the majority (at least 3/5) of the labs will result in an automatic F. Problem sets and lab reports will be submitted through Gradescope . Please refer to the pinned Piazza announcement for the course entry code. 15% Problem SetsWe will distribute 5 problem sets for you to practice your understanding of the course material. The problem sets also provide essential background material for the midterms. The problem sets will be graded primarily on an effortbasis, but if you do not work through the problem sets you are unlikely to succeed in the exams! We will distributesolutions to the problem sets after the problem sets are due to give you instant feedback. 25% Labs The labs will provide hands-on experience with the interaction of software and hardware, for a variety of machine Course Info for UCB CS152, Spring 2021 file:///C/Users/jenny/Downloads/Course%20Info%20for%20UCB%20CS152,%20Spring%202021.html [3/11/2021 4:09:39 PM]designs. We will be making extensive use of designs written in the Chisel hardware description language. Each lab includes a directed component to guide students in learning certain concepts, plus an open-ended assignment to allow students to show their creativity. Failure to complete at least three labs will result in an automatic F grade. 60% ExamsThere will be 2 midterms (15% for each) and the final exam (30%) covering the material learned in readings, labs, and problem sets. These will be closed book with no calculators, phones, smart watches, or computers of any kind allowed. See also Departmental Grading Guidelines for Undergraduate Courses . Late Assignment Policy Problem sets must be handed in at the beginning of class on the due date, with no extensions possible. Each student gets two \"free\" extensions of the lab assignments, where labs can be turned in one class after the original due date. No other extensions will be given, unless for serious documented emergencies. An automatic F grade is given if less than three labs are completed. Collaboration PolicyThe problem sets are intended to help you learn the material, and we encourage you to collaborate with other students and to ask questions in discussion sections and office hours to understand the problems. However, each student must turn in their own solutions to the problems. Students are encouraged to discuss solutions to the lab assignments with other students, but must run through the directed portion of the lab by themselves and turn in their own lab report. For the open-ended portion of each lab,students can work individually or in groups of two or three. Any open-ended lab assignment completed as a groupshould be written up and handed in separately. Students are free to take part in different groups for different labassignments. Regrade PolicyFor addition errors in the total score, return the midterm back to the TA to get it fixed. For regrades, return the midterm to the TA within a week of the midterm being graded with a separate sheet of paper explaining the discrepancy. The staff will carefully regrade the entire midterm, read the reasoning provided, and then make a final decision. Since the entire midterm is being regraded, it is possible the total score could go down as a consequence of previously undiscovered mistakes being found. We therefore recommend that regrade requests only be usedwhen the case is strong and a significant number of points are at stake. Academic Accommodation PolicyStudents with disabilities who need accommodations in order to access this course will be accommodated. Please contact DSP and apply for services. If you have emergency medical information you wish to share, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform us as soon as possible.

Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It also delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and study design. Prerequisites This course does not have any prerequisites beyond high-school algebra. The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics or computer science courses. Students with some prior experience in either statistics or computing are welcome to enroll and will find much of interest due to the innovative nature of the course. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course. Materials & Resources Our primary text is an online book called Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science (http://inferentialthinking.com/) . This text was written for the course by the course instructors. The computing platform for the course is hosted at datahub.berkeley .edu (http://datahub.berkeley .edu/) . Students find it convenient to use their own computer for the course. If you do not have adequate access to a personal computer , we have machines available for you; please contact your discussion GSI. Support You are not alone in this course; the staf f and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master , and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For questions, use Piazza  (https://piazza.com/class/kjukuuch9zp6xi) . We will also hold virtual office hours  (office-hours.html)  for real-time discussions. Your discussion T A will be your main point of contact for all course related questions/grade clarifications. The T As are here to support you so please lean on your discussion T A if you need more support in the class or have any questions/concerns. Small-group tutoring sessions will be available for students in need of additional support to develop confidence with core concepts. In past semesters, students who attended have found these sessions to be a great use of their time. Details about sign-ups will be available later in the term. Disclaimer The rest of this page details the policies that will be enforced in the Spring 2021 of fering of this course. These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staf f. 3/8/2021 Policies data8.org/sp21/policies.html 2/5All times listed below are in Pacific Standard T ime (PST). Waitlisted Students If you are on the waitlist, you must still do all coursework and complete labs and homework by the deadlines. We will not be of fering extensions if you are admitted into the course later . So it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the assignments. Unfortunately , doing all the coursework is not a guarantee of enrollment. Y ou will only be enrolled if there is space in lecture. Enrollment for lecture will proceed by CalCentral. Live Lecture Sessions Live lecture sessions will be held on Mondays, W ednesdays, and Fridays from 10am to 1 1am Pacific time over Zoom. These lectures will be used to highlight and review vital concepts of the course. Accompanying notebooks with examples will typically be provided to students. Recordings of these sessions will be provided, though students are highly encouraged to attend in real time. Vitamins To help you stay on top of lecture material, you will complete a short Gradescope \"vitamin\" - a mini-quiz - each week. The vitamin will be released on the website after lecture on Friday and due by 1 1:59pm PST the following Wednesday . Vitamins will cover the previous week's lectures and include one question that can only be answered if you attend discussion section. Your lowest two vitamin scores will be dropped. Labs This course has a 1-hour weekly lab. Y ou are required to attend lab in the first week of classes. The weekly lab session consists of a lab assignment that develops skills with computational and inferential concepts. These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Monday nights. Lab sessions are not webcast. You can get credit for each lab assignment in one of two ways described below: Attend your own assigned lab section, make progress substantial enough for your work to be checked of f, and submit your lab (even if it is incomplete) by the end of the lab period. Note that your submitted work need not be complete in order to receive full credit if you were checked of f. However , your T A will only check you of f if you have either finished the lab notebook or towards the end of the lab. Y ou must both be checked off and submit your lab notebook to receive credit. Complete the lab on your own and submit the completed lab by W ednesday morning at 8:59 a.m PST . If you choose this route, you must finish the entire lab and pass all autograder tests (100% of tests passed) to receive credit. Discussions You will also attend a weekly discussion section. Discussions will be 1 hour between Monday and W ednesday and will give you a chance to practice with material covered in lecture and practice for exams. Y ou will enroll in a discussion section, and you are only eligible to attend the discussion section you signed up for . We will be recording attendance for discussions; attendance is mandatory . 3/8/2021 Policies data8.org/sp21/policies.html 3/5We will drop the two lowest discussion scores in the calculation of your final grade. If you have questions related to discussion materials, post on the relevant Piazza thread or attend of fice hours. Homework and Projects Weekly homework assignments are a required part of the course. Y ou must complete and submit your homework independently , but you are allowed to discuss problems with other students and course staf f. See the \"Learning Cooperatively\" section below . Homeworks will be released on Friday after lecture and due the following Thursday night. If you submit a homework or project 24 hours before the deadline (W ednesday night) or earlier , you will receive 1 bonus point on that assignment. Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so you will also complete three projects involving real data. On each project, you may work with a single partner; your partner must be from the lab you enrolled in. Both partners will receive the same score. Exams The midterm exam will be held on March 12th, 7-9pm PST . Please note the date and time carefully . The final exam is required for a passing grade, and will be held on T uesday , May 1 1, 3-6pm. Please double check your course schedule to make sure that you have no conflicting finals. There will be alternate exams for both the midterm and final. More information will be posted on Piazza closer to the exam dates. Grades Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components: Activity Grade Vitamins 5% Discussion Attendance 5% Lab 5% Homework 20% Projects 20% Midterm 15% Final 30% In past semesters of Data 8, more than 40% of the students received grades in the A+/A/A- range and more than 35% received grades in the B+/B/B- range. Instructors and T As will not release grade bins during the semester , and they will be created after all grades come in by the instructors at the end of the semester . No staf f members know this information, including the instructors, so please do not ask us. Grades for Homeworks, Projects, and Labs will be posted about 1 week after the assignment's due date. There are 2 scores, OK and Gradescope, that add up together to make your total assignment score. Solutions to the assignment and common mistakes will also be posted on Piazza. It is up to you to check the solutions and request 3/8/2021 Policies data8.org/sp21/policies.html 4/5a regrade request before the regrade deadline. Regrade requests for coding OK questions should be emailed to your discussion T A and regrade requests for written Gradescope questions can be made on Gradescope. Any regrade request past the deadline will not be looked at;  this is to enforce the same deadline across all students, so please do not delay in reviewing your work. For the midterm exam, there will be a regrade request submission window . Please review the solutions and common mistakes before submitting a regrade request. Requests where a rubric item was incorrectly selected or not selected will be reviewed, but any regrade requests that ask to change the rubric or for partial credit will be ignored. Submitting Assignments After running the submit cell for Homeworks, Projects, and Labs, please click on the OkPy link and make sure that your submission is not empty (i.e. it shows an .ipynb file that is your completed notebook). W e cannot guarantee that your submission will be valid, so please double-check after you submit. Late Submission Late submissions of labs will not be accepted under any circumstances. The same goes for homeworks, unless you have relevant university accommodations filed with the DSP of fice. Your two lowest homework scores, your two lowest lab scores, your two lowest vitamin scores, and your two lowest discussion attendance scores will be dropped in the calculation of your overall grade. There will be no alternate due dates for assignments missed due to illness, other commitments, and so on. The drops are intended to cover those situations. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. Learning Cooperatively We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your assignments. No matter your academic background, you will learn more if you work alongside others than if you work alone. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally . If some emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently! Y ou should inform your discussion T A and your project partner (if you have one) immediately , so that nobody is expecting you to do something you can't finish. Academic Honesty You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partner (if you have one) and turn in one project between the two of you, and if you are attending a lab session and have a lab partner you can share everything related to that lab with your lab partner . Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the textbook and go over the lectures and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staf f. That way you will get the most out of the discussion. 3/8/2021 Policies data8.org/sp21/policies.html 5/5It is important to keep in mind the limits to collaboration. As noted above, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem solving. But you are not allowed to share your code or answers with other students. Doing so is academically dishonest, and it doesn't help them either . It sets them up for trouble on upcoming assignments and on the midterm exam. You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others . Not only is such copying dishonest, it circumvents the pedagogical goals of an assignment. Y ou must solve problems with the resources made available in the course. Y ou should never look at or have in your possession solutions from another student or another semester . Please read Berkeley's Code of Conduct  (https://sa.berkeley .edu/code-of-conduct)  carefully . Penalties for cheating in Data 8 are severe and include reporting to the Center for Student Conduct  (https://sa.berkeley .edu/conduct) . They might also include a F in the course or even dismissal from the university . It's just not worth it! When you need help, reach out to the course staf f using Piazza, in of fice hours, and/or during live labs and discussions. Y ou are not alone in Data 8! Instructors and staf f are here to help you succeed. W e expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staf f will work with integrity and with respect for you. Finally , know that it's normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles even though many try not to show it. Even if you don't learn everything that's being covered, you'll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you'll have nothing to build on. Y ou aren't expected to be perfect; it's ok not to get an A. A Parting Thought The main goal of the course is that you should learn, and have a fantastic experience doing so. Please keep that goal in mind throughout the semester . Welcome to Data 8!"

The course covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Primary emphasis is placed upon acquiring skills with which to analyze and understand current economic issues. (A) REQUIREMENTS Materials 1. Mankiw, Principle of Microeconomics, 8th Edition. (7th edition is fine too. Some earlier editions are also OK). An electronic version of the text will be available for free via the Hathitrust digital library (provided by the UC Berkeley library) which allows you to check out and read the book for a limited t ime, similar to print course reserves. 2. Reader articles posted on the class web site. 3. Selected chapters from the book “New Geography of Jobs” by Enrico Moretti. The chapters will be posted on the class web site. 4. Additional reading material will be posted o n bCourses. My lecture notes will NOT be posted on the class web site. My experience in previous classes suggests that posting lecture notes lowers student attention in class and ultimately results in reduced learning. I realize that in some cases a stude nt might want to double check her notes. GSI have my lecture notes and are happy to show them to you during their office hours. Problem Sets Each week, a Problem Set will be posted on the class web site. You are to complete the problem set and upload it on Gradescope for grading. Problem sets that are late don’t count toward your grade. Enrollment questions Our class relies on CalCentral for enrollment purposes. To add the course, check to see which sections have space and then access CalCentral. If you are already on the waiting list but want to change your section choice, access CalCentral and look under “o ptions.” 2 For all enrollment questions and concerns, please contact the GSI Coordinator John Wieselthier  (548 Evans, HeadGSI@econ.berkeley.edu) . (B) RESOURCES Web Site The course web site is on bCourses :  https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1502047 Contact s • Professor Enrico Moretti, 619 Evans Hall, (510) 642 -6649, moretti@econ.berkeley.edu I am he re to help. Please see me after class if you have quick clarifying questions or suggestions or concerns (for example: please let me know if I am going too fast for you, or too slow). I will do my best to accommodate your suggestions. • Head GSI:  Juan Diego Havraneg  <jdhavraneg@berkeley.edu> • Your GSI contact is posted on bCourses . Office Hours • Professor Moretti OH are Th 11 -1. Please send me an email to schedule your slot. • All GSI’s  OH are posted on bCourses Piazza We use Piazza in lieu of emails for questions & answers. You should have received a Piazza welcome email. If you did not receive one by January 26, or if you are asked for a code in order to enable sign up, email the Head GSI. You can post your questions about class material, conce pts or class logistics on Piazza. The GSI will be following Piazza every working day, and provide answers. In addition, every student also has the opportunity to answer your question. Answers can be edited, wiki fashion . The instructors can give a ‘thumbs up’ to good student answers. Others with the same question can see the conversation and chime in. Tutoring and Advising These are useful additional resources that are available to you: ● The Student Learning Center (SLC) offers Study Group and D rop-in Tutoring for Economics 1. See  https://slc.berkeley.edu/econ ● Economics Department graduate students offer free tutoring. See this web site for more details:  www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/home/tutoring . Twitter 3 @CalEconTutoring. The tutors aim to help students with specific questions on course concepts and problem sets by facilitating the l earning process; they don't just give out answers to assignments. ● A  list of tutors -for-hire (about $50/hour) is available at the Econ Dept Tutoring Center website: https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/under grad/home/tutoring ● In addition, t he Economic Department has helpful Undergrad Advisors: (539 Evans, ugrad@econ.berkeley.edu). They are there to assist you with schedule planning, declaring the major, making the most out of Berkeley resources, students expe riencing academic difficulty, research and honors, and much more. (C) DISCUSSION  SECTIONS Discussion sections are important. Lectures move quickly. We typically cover an entire chapter in one 50 -minute lecture. Section with your GSI is a key part of learning the material. Your active participation in section will enhance your understanding of t he course material, which will be helpful on problem sets and exams. Section is not a mini -lecture; it is a hub of active learning. Why active learning? Because every bit of research shows that we learn best when we engage in active, not passive, learning . Sections are where you work with the concepts. Think of section as a lab, akin to a chemistry or physics lab. You will work in small groups, with work to be completed in lab each day. Sections are made of three parts [1] In each Section, your GSI will star t by briefly reviewing the key concepts covered in the last lecture. You are welcome to ask any question about any part of the material covered in the last lecture. [2] Twice during the term, you and two partners will make an oral presentation. The first prese ntation will be based on an article from the reader section on Bcourses. You will briefly summarize the article and answer either the discussion question associated wit h the article. Time allotted: 7 minutes. The second presentation will be based on a news  article you have recently located. In your oral presentation, your group will summarize the article, state the link between the article and what we are covering in Economics 1, and lead your classmates in a brief discussion of two questions that you have written. The article needs to be pertinent to material covered within 2 weeks of your presentation. At least 48 hours before section, you must email your GSI a link to the article and two discussion questions; your GSI will forward the article and question s to your section. At least one of your questions must be an exam -like question. Time allotted for second presen tation and discussion period: 10 minutes. Your presentation of the art icle should take no more than 5 minutes. You will be graded on your abilit y to engage your classmates in a discussion as well as on the connection to and relevancy of the article to concepts covered in our class. [3] In each section, you will do small -group work on problems (“the section exercises”) and/or reader questions. 4 Letter of Introduction For your second section meeting, please write a one -page letter of introduction of yourself to your GSI. Include your name and anything about yourself that you would like to share. Please include or embed a photo of yourself, as this will help your GSI learn your name. (D) GRADES AND EXAMS Your course grade will be based on your performance on a comprehensive final exam, completion of the problem sets , section performance and two essay s. The weights that will be used to compute your total point score (from which a letter grade will be determined) are: Final  45% Section (Presentation , Participation, Essay s, Problem Sets ) 55% The p art of your course grade that depends upon your  performance in section  reflect s (i) attendance ( 5%); (ii) how well you do in your two presentations  (10%); (iii) how actively you participate in the class discussion that  follows each presentation ( 5%); (iv) your problem sets (15%); ( v) the quality of you r 2 essay s (20%).  To obtain full credit for section attendance you can miss up to  two sections. Please note that no additional credit will be given for missing more than two sections. There is no fixed curve for this course dictating what share of students will receive what letter grade. It is theoretically possible for everyone to ea rn an A. It is equally possible for everyone to earn a C. Even though there is no fixed curve, grade distributions are reasonably stable over time (as the Law of Large Numbers would suggest). Past performance of students in Ec onomics 1 suggests that about 30 percent of the class will receive an A of some sort, about 40 percent will receive a B of some sort, and the remainder will receive C's or below. This course can be taken Pass/Not Pass if you are otherwise free to do so. P/NP students are expected to d o the same work as other students and will receive scores on all assignments. If the course grade is a C - or better, a P/NP student will receive a Pass. P/NP students must take the final in order to pass the course. Exam The final e xam cover s all the  material from lecture, section, problem sets, textbook and all the assigned readings . There are no scheduled early or make -up exams. Exams are held only at the times noted. If you have a known conflict with either of the midterms or the final exam, you ca n’t take Econ 1 this term. 5 Students who miss an exam because of an illness must contact the Head GSI by email before 10 p.m. on the day before the  exam . Excuses must be submitted in writing to the Head GSI with proper medical documentation shortly after th at. Students who miss an exam because of any reason other than illness must contact the Head GSI by email at least 2 weeks before of the day of the midterm. If you miss the final with an acceptable excuse covering an unforeseeable and unavoidable event and you have documentation and you wer e otherwise passing the course,  then you are eligible for an incomplete in the course. You will receive cred it for the work done so far, and you will have to take the Econ 1 final in the summer or nex t Fall. Please note that the instructor, textbook and material will likely not to be the same , so you  might have to retake th e class . If you can’t take the final as scheduled, don’t take this course! (F) POLICIES AND SUGGESTIONS Suggestion on How to Approach the Material My suggestion is to interact with the material in the following order: 1) Textbook 2) Lecture 3) Problem Solving ( Section Exercise and PS) 4)  Reader Assignment 5) Review. First exposure: the textbook readings. Make notes as you read. What is unclear and leaves you with questions? Where have you seen this concept illustrated in the real world? What real world phenomena or events might be understood with the concepts in the reading? Second exposure: lecture. Take notes as you listen. Listen for answers to the questions you noted as you read the textbook. Ask questions. (Yes, the class is large, but I welcome que stions  at any time.) The concepts should be firming up in your head after this second exposure. Third exposure: problem solving in section. This is your chance to apply the concepts to new and different (often made -up) situations. Pay attention to the conc epts themselves. Are you clear on the ideas? If not, ask your group members for their insight or ask your GSI as s/he circulates around the room. And pay attention to the process you are using as you apply the concepts. What steps do you take when you need  to apply economic concepts to a new situation or problem? Fourth exposure: problem sets and reader assignment. Now you apply the concepts to a real world situation. How do the economic concepts help explain the real world situation in the article? Are the re assumptions we invoked in the textbook/class that are not satisfied in the reader article? If so, what difference does that make? Fifth exposure: review. Go back to the textbook readings. Have you cleared up any confusion? If not, get together with a st udy group, or go to office hours. Can you think of other real world situations in which these concepts apply . . . or don’t? Contacting You Prof. Moretti and the GSI’s will use email to contact you. Be sure your email address registered with the University ’s CalNet directory is correct, your spam filters are not set too 6 tight, and that your inbox is not full. Emails sent by Prof. Moretti and Head GSI are archived in the class web site. Academic Honesty Policy and Honor Code We at UC Berkeley have adopted t his Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” Your Econ 1 instructors join you in pledging to adhere to this code. In fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be harshly treated. Cheating on a midterm or the final exam results in an “F” for the course. Moreover, Professor Moretti’s policy is to report all incidences of cheating to Center for Student Conduct, which administers additional punishment. Special Accommodations If you require disability -related accommodations for exams or lecture, you need to obtain a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from Disabled Students' Program. Request for exam accommodation must be received by Head GSI Adam Smith at least two we eks before an exam, which is DSP’s own internal deadline for scheduling the proctoring of exams."

Enrollment:  All enrollment  questions should be directed to the Head GSI in the Economics Department ( headgsi@econ.berkeley.edu ) Course Description  and Objectives Welcome to Econ 1! In this course we will  study basic economic principles and some examples of their applications . Microeconomics is about how people make individual and collective decisions in a world of scarcity and macroeconomics is  about the dynamics and measurement of the economy as a whole. We will be studying both  aspects in this course, trying to better answer questions like: how is economics done? What kind of things do economists study? How do you speak their language? Can eco nomics help us to understand the world? What can it contribute to debates about public policy? We will study applications  of economic principles  to topics like climate change, immigration, healthcare, financial crises, international trade agreements, and  the minimum wage. By the end of the course, I would like you to be able to: 1. Apply , explain , and critically evaluate key concepts and ideas from areas across economics.  [CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4] 2. Understand  and be able to  use tools or j argon from economics, inc luding graphical and mathematical methods.  [PS1, PS2, CS1] 3. Find and interpret  high quality sources of ec onomic information and analysis, and write analyses and arguments of your own that use economic principles. [CS2, LL2, LL3] In the evaluation and gradi ng section below I will describe how I hope to assess how well you have achieved these goals. The terms in parentheses refer to the Economics Department’s learning goals for Economics majors, which you can learn more about by clicking here. Please ask questions both in class and in your work. Asking questions helps us all to follow what’s going on and is a great way to help you think things through and come up wi th new ideas! Note on Online Format Due to the impact of COVID -19 our class will be held remotely. We are offering the course in synchronous format with an asynchronous option. Wha t that means: all meetings will take place on Zoom at the scheduled time, but synchronous attendance is not required and you will be able to fully participate in the class without having to be online at any set time. • Class meetings : live class will be hel d on Zoom at the scheduled times for those who are willing and able to attend. All classes will be recorded and posted to bCourses for you to view whenever you choose. • Discussion sections : discussion sections will not be recorded. I strongly recommend atte nding your discussion section if at all possible. We may be able to accommodate limited switching between sections. If you have a conflict that means you’d like to request that, please contact the GSI of both the section you’re registered for and a section  that works for you to inquire. I recommend that you do not change your own section registration via CalCentral as this can result in you losing your seat in the course! • Office hours : office hours for me and the GSIs will be fully online via Zoom. You can also chat to me before class (at the top of the hour, before class proper starts at  ten after ) or after class (I will typically be able to stick around for 10 -15 minutes after each class meeting to answer questions). We will also use Piazza to answer questions a nd facilitate discussions! I will administer everything in the course through bCourses and frequently communicate with you via bCourses  announcements. Please contact me at any time if you feel that you could use extra clarity, flexibility, or support! Textbook/Required Course Materials The materials for our course are all completely free to you! We will use two freely available textbooks. First:  “The Economy” by the CORE team. You can find it at http://www.core -econ.org ---you can read it online, download a pdf, or read using an app.  Second: “Principles of Economics” by the OpenStax team. That can be found at https://openstax.org/details/books/principles -economics -2e. In the readings and resources list you will find chapter references from both books for each topic, but it is not absolutely required that you read the textbook chapters. I  encourage you to use them as references and to enrich your understanding, but all of the questions on our assessments come directly from me, so there will be no ‘gotcha’ questions based on random things mentioned deep in a textbook chapter. If you underst and the relevant concepts and techniques, as outlined on the lecture notes, in such a way that you could confidently and clearly explain them to others, then I consider you well prepared to succeed. The reason why I’m using two textbooks is that they’re quite different. The OpenStax book is much more like a ‘traditional’ economics principles textbook  with clear explanations of fundamental models and concepts in economics , while the CORE book puts more emphasis on history, applications, and data.  Both are excellent and free, so I didn’t want to choose between them. I encourage you to refer to both for their different perspectives, but please feel free to focus on the one that most appeals to you. My lecture notes will be available on bCourses. In my notes  and in our discussion sections  I will try to blend the approaches of the two texts ---traditional textbook -style economics with political and historical context and applications. There will also be required and optional readings  other than the two free textbooks  during our course ---see the Readings and Resources document for much more! Evaluation and Grading Your grade will be determined by your performance on three  quizzes  (25%), three homeworks  (25%), responses to required readings and videos (10%), a presentation on a reading once during the semester (10%), and a final exam ( 30%).  Due dates for everything are on the bCourses site. Reading responses are 300-500 words on  assigned pieces of media (articles, papers, v ideo, audio). These will be either open -ended ---what in the readings raised questions for you, interested you, or was confusing to you ---or in response to specific questi ons. There will be eight in total ---one for each two of our 16 topics . Once during t he semester you and a partner in your discussion section  will make a presentation on the non-required readings for one topic . Please see the Readings and Resources document for more on the procedures and requirements for that assignment. Quizzes will be 40 minutes each and will be administered through Gradescope . Quizzes will be on Fridays  with two times  (with different versions)  to choose from  at no on or 10pm Pacific , to accommodate time zone issues  (if you are conflicted out of both options, we will work out an alternative time for you). Late submissions will get a 1 point penalty per 2 minutes late. They will test your ability to explain economic concepts in plain English and work through simple mathematical models. They are desi gned to be a slightly more frequent and lower -stakes alternative to midterm exams. Since we are online only, I will make the quizzes open note, but you may not share or discuss the quizzes with anyone for any reason until the day after they occur. Homewor ks will  let us go in to a bit more depth than the quizzes. You will be tested on  your ability to write policy analyses and arguments based on your knowledge of economics, to access and interpret data to make these analyses , and to demonstrate understanding  of fundamental mathematical concepts and models . Study groups are OK , but you must ultimately submit your own answers and work ---no duplicate answers will be accepted. The final exam will be at 3pm on May 10th (or an alternate time TBD for those with ti me zone conflicts) , with a 2 hour time limit to submit your answers after you start. The final is comprehensive of the whole course  and will include a section with mathematical or graphical problems and short answer questions in the spirit of the quizzes and homeworks, and a section in which you will select an essay prompt from a list to write an essay of around 800 words.  The essay portio n is designed to let you focus on the areas of the course that you found particularly interesting when you study for the final! Academic Integrity Please be honest in your work for our class. The Honor  Code adopted by the UC Berkeley student community says “[a]s a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” I expect you to hold up that commitment. If you’re worried about how the class is going for you, co me and talk to me about it. I am always happy to work with you to help you to succeed. To give two important examples, drawing from the Division of Student Affairs’ Academic Integrity website ( https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity ): you must always identify original sources, words, or ideas that you use in your work, and you must submit your own individual and original work for individual assignments or the original work of your group collaborat ively for group assignments. If you need guidance about my expectations about academic integrity in any situation, please ask. This is particularly relevant under remote learning since the quizzes and exam will be online. You may absolutely not share or d iscuss any quiz or exam questions or answers with anyone else for any reason until after the window to take the assessment has closed. The timed assessments are open note, but using outside sources like websites during the exam is not allowed. All work on the quizzes and exams must be your own, unassisted by anyone else. It’s extremely important to me that the assessments reflect your knowledge and understanding and no -one else’s, and to be fair to students who are honest in their work, evidence of cheating  will be dealt with harshly. Cheating on a quiz or exam will result in an F for the course, and cheating will be reported to the Center for Student Conduct. Course Policies • Live class: please have your video on in the live class if it’s technically feasi ble for you ---it really, really helps me to see visual feedback and helps us to build community in discussions. I encourage you to use the chat box or the raise hand button to ask questions or make comments ---I keep an eye on the chat box and address quest ions there as they come up. • Communication: I will send messages to the class via bCourses Announcements and, for less important notes, Piazza. If you’d like to get bCourses Announcements by email, please make sure to check the relevant settings in your bC ourses profile! • Deadlines and extensions: I am always happy to give extensions on take -home work without penalty for any reason as long as you contact your GSI in advance with the request. To make sure we can grade and post solutions quickly, the maximum e xtension on any take -home work is 5 days. Please be specific about what extension you are asking for when you make your requests! • Missing quizzes or exams:  since the quizzes are time sensitive, we can offer extensions on them only in genuine emergency situ ations. Contact your GSI as soon as possible if you will be unable to take a quiz on the scheduled day, and we will make a decision about how to make it up. • Piazza: I’ll set up a Piazza site for our class, linked through bCourses. On Piazza you can post questions and respond to questions from other students. Please treat Piazza as you would treat email to me: be professional. The GSIs and I will monitor Piazza to answer questions when we can. It’s a good alternative to emailing me for help since we have a v ery large class, which limits my ability to quickly respond to email questions about coursework. Plus it lets us all support each other’s understanding of the material! Of course, you should definitely always feel free to email me anytime with questions or  to chat about the course or economics in general, and I’ll reply as soon as I can. • Workload: I expect you to work at least a couple of hours per class hour. This will include reading/watching material in advance and taking notes, responding to assignments , and reviewing and practicing material. • Regrade requests: all regrade requests must be made in writing to your GSI within one week of getting a graded assessment back. In the case of clear mistakes (adding up scores or overlooking a question) it may be po ssible to make changes. Anything more substantive will result in a complete regrade of your whole assignment, and your score may go up or down as a result. I discourage you from submitting speculative regrade requests or requests based on matters of the su bjective judgement of the grader ---since we strive for consistency and fairness above all else when we grade, it is extremely important to me that we treat everyone’s work identically, and so we are unlikely to change decisions that have been commonly appl ied to all students’ work. Tips for productive learning in this class • When you read, listen  to an explanat ion or demonstration, or discuss  material with a group, take notes. Note -taking is the best way to help you remember the ideas you had at the time! • Take notes beyond just what the material says. Jot down your own thoughts, criticisms of the material, connections to other topics in the course or knowledge that you have, questions for me or your fellow students, and so on. One extra useful way to take notes is to relate what you are studying to applications that you can think of from the real world. • Taking more than one pass at the material and working through examples of graphs or maths are two great ways to help you to understand it well. Try looking up tricky ideas or examples in both textbooks to get a couple of different perspectives. • Always try a problem for yourself for a little while, but never try a problem by yourself for too long. If you’ve given it a shot and are really stuck, ask me , one of our wonderful GSIs,  or your classmates. It is totally normal not to “get it” a lot of the time. Academic Support The Economics Department offers free tutoring for this course, held by grad students in the Department (https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/home/tutoring ). From that website you can also see the department’s list of private tutors for hire. The Student Learning Center ( https://slc.berkeley.edu/economics ) is a great resource to help you when you feel you may benefit from academic support. Students who may require academic accommodations should make the necessary arrangeme nts as soon as possible. I strongly encourage anyone who feels they need such accommodations to work with the relevant office to get the support you need so that you can put yourself in the best position to succeed. The Academic Accommodations Hub ( https://evcp.berkeley.edu/programs -resources/academic - accommodations -hub) can guide you. Limits to Confidentiality As University of California  employees, all course instruc tors and tutors ar e “Responsible Employees”. This means that w e are required to report incidents of  sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by university policy to the Title IX officer ---we cannot keep  reports of sexual harassment o r sexual violence confidential. However,  the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality  after an incident has been reported . Confidential resources are available , including the PATH to Care Center  (http://sa.berkeley.edu/dean/confidential -care-advocate ), which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment. Provisional course  outline Here’s  the provisional schedule of topics; depending on how things go this may change along the way. Each date refers to a live Zoom class ---the topic will also be covered in one of that week’s sections. Please take a look at the Readings and Resources document for more details and to find the required and optional readings. If y ou have particular interests that aren’t covered here, or you want to dive in deeper to anything we study, I would love to chat and try to support your learning more about them ---get in touch!

The courses have a particular emphasis on how to build and understand systems interacting with the world from an informational point of view. Mathematical modeling is an important theme throughout these courses, and students will learn many conceptual tools along the way. These concepts are rooted in speciﬁc application domains. Students should understand why they are learning something. An important part of being a successful engineer is being able to identify the important and relevant structure in a complex problem while ignoring minor issues. EECS 16A focuses on modeling as abstraction: how can we see the relevant underlying structure in a problem? It introduces the basics of linear modeling, largely from a \"static\" and deterministic point of view. EECS 16B deepens the understanding of linear modeling and introduces dynamics and control, along with additional applications. Finally, EECS 70, (which can be thought of as the third course in this sequence --- except without any labs), introduces additional discrete structures for modeling problems, and brings in probability. In EECS 16A in particular, we will use the application domains of imaging and tomography, smartphones and touchscreens, and GPS and localization to motivate and inspire. Along the way, we will learn the basics of linear algebra and, more importantly, the linear-algebraic way of looking at the world. The emphasis will be on modeling and using linear structures to solve problems; the class is not just focused on how to do computations. We will learn about linear circuits, not merely as a powerful and creative way to help connect the physical world to what we can process computationally, but also as an exemplar of linearity and as a vehicle for learning how to do design. Circuits also provide a concrete setting in which to learn the key concept of \"equivalence\" --- an important aspect of abstraction. Our hope is that the concepts you learn in EECS 16A will help you as you tackle more advanced courses and will help form a solid conceptual framework that will help you learn throughout your career. Grade Breakdown Our objective is to help you become the best engineer you can be, and grades are not everything. The various components of the class -- homework, labs and exams -- are designed explicitly with this in mind. Every challenge is a growth opportunity. You will have the opportunity to gain points in the course through completing your homework and attending labs as well as through the exams. This course is not graded on a curve. We will set absolute thresholds for performance that will map to grade boundaries. We encourage you to discuss the course material with each other and teach each other new ideas and concepts that you learn. Teaching the material is one of the best ways to learn, so discussing course material with colleagues in the class is a win-win situation for everyone. Grades are not everything, far from it, but that said, here is the breakdown for grading for this class. Category Points (out of 300) Participation/Staying On Track 10 points Homework 45 points Labs 45 points Midterm 1 50 points Midterm 2 50 points Final 100 points 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 2/10Notice that you can get many points by being regular with your homework and the labs. Our goal is to help you learn the material as best as possible! Grading Scale This course is not curved. We deﬁne the following grading scale (in percentages): A [93+)A- [90+) B+[84+)B [75+)B-[68+) C+[65+)C [62+)C-[58+) D+[57+)D [55+)D-[53+) F [0-, 53) In the rare event that the instructors deem that a change needs to be made for a given exam, then you will be told where the grade boundaries are for that exam and how to adjust your score on the exam to get your points on the above scale. You will always know how you are doing in the course grade-wise. Exam \"Second Chance\" Policy This course spans a fairly broad set of ideas and concepts within a short period of time, and hence sustained and consistent eﬀort and investment are critical to your success in this class. Similarly, by far the most common operating mode we have observed in previous students who struggled and/or failed this class was attempting to do the bare minimum in general and then catch up/cram right before the exams. In order to formally encourage all of you to maintain the sustained eﬀort that we have observed to be critical to success, we will be adopting a new policy regarding exam clobbering, participation, and eﬀort. Speciﬁcally, for students who (1) complete an optional midterm redo and (2) perform signiﬁcantly better on the ﬁnal than on the relevant midterm, we will provide the opportunity to clobber a midterm. If you qualify for the second chance policy (i.e. (1) and (2)), you may replace your lowest midterm score with your scaled score on the ﬁnal exam according to the formula below. Replacement MT score (on scale of 100) = max [MT score, ﬁnal exam score - 15% (on scale of 100)] This essentially allows you to replace your midterm grade by a higher grade --- we want to reward improved performance. If you complete the optional midterm redo for both midterms, and are eligible for a second chance on both midterms, we will choose the exam that helps your overall grade the most. Please note that even though lecture attendance is not included (for logistical reasons) in the two criteria for clobbering eligibility, we do strongly encourage you to attend lecture in person.EECS 16A Grade Breakdown Participation Homework Labs Midterm 1 Midterm 2 Final15% 15%33.3% 16.7% 16.7% 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 3/10Homework Party and Oﬃce Hours Homework parties (held at this queue (https://oh.eecs16a.org/)) are your chance to meet and interact with other students, while also having the chance to get help from GSIs, Tutors and Faculty. This is your chance to have a social experience as part of the class. We expect students to treat each other with respect during homework parties as well as during all other parts of the class, including interactions on Piazza (https://piazza.com/class/kjxe8woei5v5hr), discussion, and oﬃce hours (at https://oh.eecs16a.org/ (https://oh.eecs16a.org/)). Remember that each of you is coming into a class with diﬀerent experiences and backgrounds -- use this as an opportunity to learn from one another. Thursdays 2-4PM PT, HW Party will be held online. Attending homework party is highly encouraged and is a great way to ﬁnd a study group! Students are expected to help each other out, and if desired, form ad-hoc \"pickup\" homework groups in the style of a pickup basketball game. We highly encourage students to attend homework party. This year, homework parties will be hosted online. Oﬃce Hours will be held every day (at this link (https://oh.eecs16a.org/)), as annotated on the course Google calendar. You can come to oﬃce hours with your study groups, or by yourself -- there will be one or more TAs there to help you work through the concepts or the homework! OH and HW Party Walkthrough (Fa20!) Homework Submission Homeworks are due on Friday night at 11:59 PM Paciﬁc Time (PT). You need to turn in a .pdf ﬁle consisting of your written-up solutions that also includes an attached pdf \"printout\" of your .ipynb code on Gradescope. In addition, Gradescope has an option to associate pages of your work to each homework problem. You must select the relevant pages for every problem. Any homework submissions that are turned in without the code “printout” (or screenshot) attached will receive a zero on the coded ipython notebook portions of the homework. Any problems without pages selected will receive zero credit. If you have any questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to oﬃce hours or homework party. Additionally, we will provide HW accommodations for students who have letters of accommodations from DSP services and will be handled on a case-by-case basis. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your homework after homework solutions are released to get makeup credit. See below for details. Homework Grading – Self-Gradingeecs16a_fa20_OH_HWP ar ty_W alkthr ough eecs16a_fa20_OH_HWP ar ty_W alkthr ough 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 4/10The point of homework in this class is for you to learn the material. To help you in doing this, you will both grade your own homework and be graded by 16A readers. After the HW deadline, oﬃcial solutions will be posted online. You will then be expected to read them and enter your own scores and comments for every part of every problem in the homework on a simple coarse scale. ScoreReason 0 Didn't attempt or very very wrong 2 Got started and made some progress, but went oﬀ in the wrong direction or with no clear direction 5 Right direction and got half-way there 8 Mostly right but a minor thing missing or wrong 10 100% correct Note: You must justify self-grades of 2, 5 or 8 with a comment. Grades of 0 and 10 do not need to be justiﬁed. If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on Piazza. This is not supposed to be a stressful process. Your self-grades will be due on the Monday following the homework deadline at 11:59 PM sharp. Weekly discussion checkoﬀs (in case you did not attend live discussion the previous weeks) will be due at the same time. (For example: Homework 1 will be due on Friday 1/29 at 11:59 PM. The following Monday, 2/1, at 11:59 PM, your Homework 1 self-grades will be due along with the discussion checkoﬀ forms for the week of 1/25-1/29.) Your self-grades will be due on the Monday following the homework deadline at 11:59 PM sharp. We will accept late self-grades up to a week after the original homework deadline for 75% credit on the associated homework assignment. If you don't enter a proper grade by this deadline, you are giving yourself a zero on that assignment. Merely doing the homework is not enough, you must do the homework; turn it in on time; read the solutions; do the self-grade; and turn it in on time. Unless all of these steps are done, you will get a zero for that assignment. We will automatically drop the lowest homework score from your ﬁnal grade calculation. This drop is meant for emergencies. If you use this drop half-way into the semester, and request another, we cannot help you. EECS47D students will not have their lowest homework score dropped. Just like we encourage you to use a study group for doing your homework, we strongly encourage you to have others help you in grading your assignments while you help grade theirs. Course readers are going to be grading and sending you occasional comments. Because we have reader grades, we will catch any attempts at trying to inﬂate your own scores. This will be considered cheating and is deﬁnitely not worth the risk. Your own scores will be used in computing your ﬁnal grade for the course, adjusted by taking into account reader scores so that everyone is fairly graded eﬀectively on the same scale. For example, if we notice that you tend to give yourself 5s on questions where readers looking at your homeworks tend to give you 8s, we will apply an upward correction to adjust. Reader grades will be released on Gradescope about one week after the homework deadline. Readers grade questions either on a “coarse” or “ﬁne” scale for each homework part. Coarsely graded question parts are worth a single point and are based on eﬀort. Finely graded question parts are worth a total of 10 points and are graded using the same self-grading rubric above. Homework regrade requests are typically due on Gradescope within 72 hours of reader grades being released. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the homework, the grader reserves the right to regrade the entire homework and could potentially take points oﬀ. If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza. If you are curious as to how your homework scores are calculated, please look at the formula below. 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 5/10 Self-Grade Walkthrough Homework Resubmission Again, the point of homework in this class is to help you learn. We understand that sometimes work from other classes, midterms or your personal life can come in the way of making a homework deadline. For this reason we will allow you to resubmit your homework for 70% credit. Homework resubmissions must be HANDWRITTEN. Homework resubmissions will be due along with the self-grades, so they will be due by 11:59pm Monday night. If you choose to resubmit your homework, you must submit two sets of self-grades, one for the ﬁrst submission and one for the second submission. For the second submission, do self-grades as normal. We will apply the 70% correction. What does 70% credit mean? Let us say you only were able to get halfway through a problem during the ﬁrst submission. You submitted your homework on Friday, and while going through the solutions you ﬁgured out how to do the whole problem. Your self-grade for your ﬁrst submission would be a 5/10. However, you can resubmit the 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 6/10homework problem with a fully correct solution and receive 70% of the remaining points as extra points, i.e. (10-5) * 70/100 = 3.5 extra points, and so your score for the problem would go from 5 points to 8.5 points. Homework Eﬀort Policy Because the point of homework in this class is to help you learn, not to punish you for making small mistakes, if your ﬁnal score (after resubmission and any other corrections are applied) on any homework is above 8/10, your grade will automatically be bumped up to 100% (10/10). If your ﬁnal score is less than 8/10, it will be scaled accordingly so that a 6/10 will result in 75% (7.5/10). Participation in Discussion Discussion is a key component to learning the material in this class, and to keep you motivated and on track, you can earn points towards your grade by attending discussion. Participation is worth a maximum of 10 points. This is measured by discussion attendance. If you attend a discussion section live your attendance will automatically be counted through Zoom attendance. If you choose instead to watch a recording, you must ﬁll out a Google form and describe what you learned in the discussion video. You must attend/watch 16 discussion sections to get full participation points. If you do not get full credit, your grade will be prorated by the number of discussion checkoﬀs you complete; e.g., if you attend (watch) 14 discussions or complete 14 checkoﬀs, you will have 14/16 * 10 = 8.7 points in this category. Lab and Discussion Section Policies Ways to check attendance will be posted on Piazza on a later date. Labs for this class are not open section, you must go to your assigned lab section . Credit for each lab is based on completion and checkoﬀ with a lab TA during your assigned lab section. In a checkoﬀ, you will demonstrate your work from portions of the lab and answer conceptual questions related to the lab. You should aim to get checked oﬀ by the end of your lab section. If (and only if) you attend your lab section for the whole duration but do not ﬁnish in time, you may get checked oﬀ at the beginning of your next lab section before starting the following lab. While labs are not meant to be burdensome, they are an essential part of the course. We have the following grading policy for labs: If you complete all the labs, you will receive full lab credit. If you fail to complete one lab, you will receive almost full 44/45 lab credit. If you miss two labs, you will receive 42/45. If you miss three labs, you will receive 23/45 (half credit). If you miss four or more labs, you will get an F in the class. Number of Missed Labs What Happens? 0 You get full lab credit - 45/45 1 You get almost full lab credit - 44/45 2 You get most lab credit - 42/45 3 You get half lab credit - 23/45 4 or more You Fail the class - ﬁnal letter grade: F Some lab sections are “buﬀer labs.” These occur during several-day periods in which no new labs begin and are oﬀered during all regular lab times. During buﬀer lab periods, you may get checked oﬀ for only one missed lab that occurred during that lab module by attending your regular assigned section . No other labs can be checked oﬀ. The eligible labs for makeup for each buﬀer lab period are indicated on the course schedule. If you have already completed all labs for a particular lab module, you do not need to attend the buﬀer lab for that module. Wires on lab breadboards must be planar. All students will receive a lab kit to use during lab sections. Lab staﬀ will ask students to redo their circuits before debugging them if the wires are non-planar. The deﬁnition of planar wires on a breadboard is shown below: Planar Non-planar 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 7/10 Exam Policies There are two midterms and one ﬁnal. The midterms will be held Monday, March 1st from 7:00pm to 9:00pm PT and Monday, April 12th from 7:00pm to 9:00pm PT. The ﬁnal will be held on Wednesday, May 12th from 11:30am to 2:30pm PT. These times have been carefully chosen to be reasonable in most time zones across the world. Makeup exams will not be scheduled. In general, alternate exam times will not be provided, except in extenuating circumstances regarding timezones or students requiring speciﬁc accommodations. Alternate exams will in general not be provided for students who have scheduled classes with time-conﬂicts. Please contact us privately if you have any concerns. Please plan for exams at these times. In case of an emergency on exam day, please email the Head GSI at eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu) as soon as possible and provide details of the issue as well as a contact phone number. Emergency exam conﬂicts will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Exam conﬂicts originating from a lecture conﬂict will not be accommodated. Regrade requests on Gradescope are typically soon after exam scores are released on Gradescope. Late regrade requests will not be considered. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the exam, the grader reserves the right to regrade the entire exam and could potentially take points oﬀ. Exam Proctoring Remote proctoring will be taking place for the midterms and ﬁnal exam. Virtual backgrounds will not be permitted. Please read the detailed proctoring policy available here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pnWwxyZ40nlpbCM4aOYTxXOjc36sIQaMx9m8zyaR8w/edit). Please note that these policies may be adjusted as we get closer to exam time, but this doc will still provide a good idea of what to expect. Exceptions and Exam Accommodations Any requests for exceptions should be emailed to the Head GSI at eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu). Email the exception request as soon as possible. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Since there is one homework drop, missing homework is rarely excused. Examples of situations that merit an exception are medical emergencies and family emergencies. It will be easier for us to grant an exception if you have a doctor’s note or other documentation. Accommodations will be provided to students who have letters of accommodations from DSP services and students facing hardships. Student hardships may include residing in a time zone that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from Berkeley’s time zone and family/medical emergencies (please provide documentation for your records). If you can foresee unstable or limited WiFi access to an upcoming exam, contact eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu) to determine a procedure that will support you. Additionally, if your WiFi access is disrupted or fails during the exam, contact eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu) as soon as possible for an alternative arrangement. Course Communication 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 8/10The instructors and TAs will post announcements, clariﬁcations, hints, etc. on Piazza. So, you must check the EECS16A Piazza page frequently throughout the term. (You should already have access to the EECS16A Spring 2021 Piazza (https://piazza.com/class/kjxe8woei5v5hr) . If you do not, please let us know.) If you have a question, your best option is to post a message on Piazza. The staﬀ (instructors and TAs) will check Piazza regularly, and if you use Piazza, other students will be able to help you too. When using Piazza, please avoid oﬀ-topic discussions, and please do not post answers to homework questions before the homework is due. Also, always look for a convenient category to post the question to (for example, each homework will have its own category, so please post there). That will ensure you get the answer faster. If your question is personal or not of interest to other students, you may mark your question as private on Piazza, so only the instructors will see it. If you wish to talk with one of us individually, you are welcome to come to our oﬃce hours at https://oh.eecs16a.org/ (https://oh.eecs16a.org/). Please reserve email for the questions you can't get answered in oﬃce hours, in discussion sections, or through Piazza. For any exceptions that are of a personal nature, please contact the head GSI at eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu). Technical and homework questions are best resolved in homework party and during oﬃce hours (click here (https://oh.eecs16a.org/) to visit the queue). It can be challenging for the instructors to gauge how smoothly the class is going. We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. If you would like to send anonymous comments or criticisms, please ﬁll out this anonymous feedback form (https://forms.gle/imHwK9ENNaQXZRgu7). Collaboration We encourage you to work on homework problems in study groups of two to four people; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your write up, and you must never copy material verbatim. Using previous EECS 16A homework, exam, and lab solutions is strictly prohibited, and will be considered academic dishonesty. This is not how you want to start your career as an engineer. We expect that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we encourage strongly. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize the subject matter. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with, or who has given you any signiﬁcant ideas about the homework. This is good scholarly conduct. Collaboration during exams or other designated assessments is strictly forbidden, subject to the Berkeley Honor Code (https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code), Code of Conduct (https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/faculty-staﬀ/violations), and the parameters of the speciﬁc assessment. 16A Study Group Formation During an in-person semester, we would traditionally have many opportunities for students to get to know their peers and form study-groups. To adapt to the current semester, we are rolling out a brand new system for study- group formation where you can request study partners just by submitting a simple Google preference survey. This survey is part of the ﬁrst homework, and is worth points on the HW, so please make sure you ﬁll it out. The homework starting week 2 will be signiﬁcantly longer than the ﬁrst homework, so having people to brainstorm with can be very helpful and improve your learning. We will try to create groups of students based on what year you are, what other courses you are taking and your time preferences. We are hoping the groups will be ready in time for you to work on Homework 2 together. Please make sure you ﬁll out the survey! Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help Are you struggling? Please come talk with us! The earlier we learn about your struggles, the more likely it is that we can help you. Waiting until right before an exam or the last few weeks of the semester to let us know about your problems is not an eﬀective strategy - the later it is, the less we will be able to help you. Even if you are convinced that you are the only person in the class who is struggling, please overcome any feelings of embarrassment or guilt, and come ask for help as soon as you need it -- we can almost guarantee you're not the only person who feels this way. Don't hesitate to ask us for help -- we really do care that you thrive! You can email eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu), or email / talk to any TA at any time -- we’re happy to help. Inclusion 3/8/2021 EECS16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I, Spring 2021 https://eecs16a.or g/policies.html 9/10We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you. We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected. Even if you are convinced that you are the only person in the class who is struggling, please overcome any feelings of embarrassment or guilt, and come ask for help as soon as you need it -- we can almost guarantee you're not the only person who feels this way. Don't hesitate to ask us for help -- we really do care that you thrive! You can email eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu), or email / talk to any TA at any time -- we’re happy to help. Berkeley Honor Code Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to this code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” Accommodation policy: We honor and respect the diﬀerent learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class. If you need religious or disability-related accommodations, if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with us, please share this information with as needed. You may write to the course email address eecs16a@berkeley.edu (mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu) and please also see DSP and CPS under “Resources”. Policy on Course Content You are free and encouraged to use course materials for personal use (in collaborations with other students, in your research, etc.). You may NOT post HW/Exams/Solutions anywhere on the web because this could encourage cheating down the road. You are expressly prohibited from uploading course materials to websites such as coursehero.com or chegg.com, which distribute and monetize content without compensation to the University. Course material, including all video, is copyrighted and reposting to third party sites or any other form of redistribution is prohibited.

UC Berkeley Food Pantry (https://pantry.berkeley.edu): The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staﬀ at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staﬀ can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staﬀ who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support. Technology Needs (STEP): Student Technology Equity Program (STEP). STEP provides laptops and other technologies for free and is for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It requires just a simple online application form. The laptops provided are brand-new, come with four years of premier support, and meet basic requirements for students in all ﬁelds of study. There also will be opportunities for students to apply for and pick up equipment in person - curbside and contactless - at the Student Union over the next few weeks. If students live outside the Berkeley area, STEP will ship the equipment directly to them, free. STEP will continue to distribute hardware throughout the academic year, while supplies last. Advice The following tips are oﬀered based on our experience. Do the homeworks! The homeworks are explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. There is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and ﬁnal grades in the class. Keep up with lectures! Discussion sections, labs and homeworks all touch on portions of what we discuss in lecture. Students do much better if they stay on track with the course. That will also help you keep the pace with your homework and study group. Take part in discussion sections! Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with oﬃce hours (https://oh.eecs16a.org/), the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to beneﬁt from it. Please come to oﬃce hours! (https://oh.eecs16a.org/) We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the material better. Form study groups! As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. And recall the caveat above that you must write up your solutions on your own. We advise you strongly to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get you in practice for the exams. Make sure you work through all problems yourself, and that your ﬁnal write-up is your own. Some groups try to split up the problems (\"you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap notes\"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a lot less from this course."

The main goal of lab is for you to gain experience applying concepts from lecture. You will build your physical intuition and conﬁdence with problem-solving skills, including critical thinking, design thinking, and tenacity via debugging. This goal subsumes the following sub-goals: 1. Build the conﬁdence to get started on something when you don’t know how it will end. 2. Know how to check your work without merely checking each step along the way. 3. Know how to simplify a problem and identify its base cases. 4. Understand how to try different approaches without knowing whether they will work, and how to recognize when in fact it has or has not worked. 5. Understand how to try these approaches systematically instead of randomly, and be able to explicitly express what tentative assumptions you are making or which possibilities you discover while exploring. 6. Know how to work backwards — assuming that you could somehow by magic get to intermediate point X, how could that help you get to the goal? And, be able to take initiative and explore whether you can in fact get to intermediate point X. 7. Be able to take given components and use them to get the result that you want. You will be completing either hands-on orlab lite labs. Hands-on labs involve physical circuit building and de- bugging. Lab lite labs build an understanding of circuit building concepts in a software format, through simulation and analysis. In any given week, both labs will emphasize the same lecture concepts and design goals. We want lab to be a positive experience for everyone; in fact, the point of lab is to be rewarding and satisfy- ing. However, this does not mean that lab is supposed to be easy. The staff are here to support you and provide you with the resources (including mental schema) you need as you build the perseverance to debug, but we will never do your work for you. That being said, if you are having a hard time or feel that you are falling behind in the class as a whole, please do not hesitate to reach out to your lab TA: ﬁrst and foremost, we are here to help you. Grading and Policies Lab is worth 50pts (out of 300pts total) of your ﬁnal grade for 16B, for both hands-on lab and lab lite. We believe it is possible for every student to perform highly in lab if you work diligently, pay attention during checkoffs for hands-on labs and attend help sessions for lab lite, and follow the tips outlined in the ﬁnal section. Within lab, grading is broken into: Labs (4 total) 40% Project 60% The project breakdown is as follows: Checkpoints (5 total) 60% Integration/Final Demo 20% Final Report 20% The following section on lab policies is broken down between hands-on lab and lab lite. 1 Lab Syllabus EECS 16B Designing Information Devices & Systems II Spring 2021 G. Ranade and V. Stojanovic Lab Syllabus Hands-On Lab •Attendance is mandatory, and you MUST come to your assigned lab section. This is because this class is very full, and lab sections only have enough staff to support the students registered for that section. • Hands-on labs are graded on an all-or-nothing basis.* Being checked off on time means that you have received full credit for the lab. A lab is considered “on-time” if you are checked off any time before your next lab section, so you have one week to complete each lab. If your lab is late, 50% of the credit will be deducted. Extensions are given at the discretion of your lab GSI. Checkoffs can be viewed on Gradescope. • *TAs will accept high-effort, close-to-done labs at their discretion for full credit given thorough understanding of the lab. This is to reduce overﬂow and stress as much as possible. • If you did not ﬁnish your lab in your section, ﬁnd a section that works for both you and your partners. One of you should email the TA that leads that section >24 hours in advance to ask if they have space for you in their section. CC your normal section’s TA and group members. Format the subject line as “[EE16B] (time of lab to attend) Makeup Lab.” If you attend a section without prior explicit approval, you might not receive help. • Labs are an essential part of the course. Therefore, if by the end of the semester you miss 4 or more submis- sions, you will fail the class. Your ﬁnal grade will be an NP or F depending on your grading option. •Allpartners must be present for checkoff. You will be working and getting checked off in your groups, but credit will be given on an individual basis. At least one group member must have a functional circuit to be able to receive credit, but all group members must have made signiﬁcant progress. • Circuits must be kept neat, according to circuit building guidelines. Here is quick list of important things to consider for a successful hardware assembly: 1. Be neat and organized. All breadboard wiring should be planar - avoid spaghetti wiring. 2. Measure the voltage at circuit nodes as you are building your circuit up and compare with your expectations. This will help you identify problems early. 3. Often check for loose contacts. These are the main reason for circuits not working - or working unreliably. Hands-on Lab Structure • Hands-on labs are 3 hours long, led by one TA and staffed by several lab assistants. Every lab will start with a short lecture (approx. 15 minutes in length) given by your lab TA over Zoom that will give you an overview of the lab, review the relevant theory, and give you useful tips that will help you avoid common mistakes. After the lecture, you will have the rest of the lab period to work. • If you need assistance during the lab period, you can submit a help form and a TA/lab assistant will join your Zoom call when they are available. The process for checkoff is similar; you will ﬁll out a checkoff request form and a TA/lab assistant will join your Zoom call. You MUST have your checkoff request submitted 10 minutes before the end of lab to give you a bit of a time buffer in case the queue is long so that staff can get to you before the next section starts. • You will work in groups of 3 to 4 with other students in your section. Ideally, this group will be the same each week, but you can change groups until the project starts. Once the project starts, you must stay with your group through the rest of the semester. 2 Lab Syllabus EECS 16B Designing Information Devices & Systems II Spring 2021 G. Ranade and V. Stojanovic Lab Syllabus Lab Lite • Lab lite can be completed asynchronously , and there are no set section times that you must attend. We recom- mend that you set aside time each week to complete the lab and ask any questions you may have. There will be scheduled lab lite-speciﬁc ofﬁce hours each week for questions, and we encourage you to take advantage of this time! Lab lite questions will not be answered on Piazza by staff, although you are welcome to discuss with other students on Piazza. • Labs are submitted online and are graded on correctness by an autograder that will be run after the lab deadline. You will have one week to complete each lab. Labs cannot be submitted late for credit. • Labs are an essential part of the course. Therefore, if by the end of the semester you miss 3 or more submis- sions, you will fail the class. Your ﬁnal grade will be an NP or F depending on your grading option. • Every lab lite student must make an individual submission for each lab. However, you are welcome to work in pairs or in groups to share ideas, as long the work you submit is your own. LPTs: Lab Pro Tips Following these tips will ensure you succeed in and get the most out of lab. 1. Read through the lab note and lab notebook before coming to lab. Think carefully about what possible bugs you may encounter, or which parts of the lab will take longest, and have a plan for avoiding those bugs and staying on-track time-wise. 2. If there is a lab problem on the homework, make sure you do it prior to your lab section. We put these problems on the homework to save you as much time as possible in lab and perhaps even help you ﬁnish early. This and tip number 1 are the top tips for making sure that you ﬁnish on time and get the most out of lab — if you follow these tips, you won’t be scrambling to ﬁnish and will have the time to develop a deep understanding of the lab. 3. Talk to the other students in lab, not just your partner(s). Utilize Piazza and other electronic platforms to ask others if they have encountered similar bugs or problems and what they have tried to ﬁx it. Or, if you’ve already ﬁxed that bug, offer them some pointers. 4. For hands-on labs, as you’re working through the lab, formulate sanity-check questions that allow you to quickly check if there is something wrong with your circuit. Ex: What should VDD and VSS be? What voltage do I expect at this node? What do I expect the signal at this node to look like? 5. For hands-on labs, get to know your lab partner(s). You will be working with them all semester, including the entirety of the project. This also extends to the other students in your section. For lab lite, form groups to work on labs together each week. It’s much easier to work with friends! 3 Lab Syllabus EECS 16B Designing Information Devices & Systems II Spring 2021 G. Ranade and V.

Course objectives E7 is an introductory course on computer programming for lower-division students in science and engineering.  The principal goal of the course is to teach basic computer programming concepts and apply them to computer-based problem-solving methods.  The course stresses hands-on computer programming using MATLAB, a powerful high-level programming environment. 2. Course Format E7 consists of classroom lectures, computer laboratory sections, and classroom discussions. The faculty instructor delivers lectures and discussions, while graduate student instructors (GSIs) supervise laboratory sections. Lectures begin on  Wednesday January 18  th  and are  held Mondays and Wednesdays in  155 Dwinelle Hall  .  The lecture time is from 4pm to 5pm. Discussions begin on  Friday, January 20  th  ,  and will be held in  155  Dwinelle Hall every Friday (4pm-5pm).  During the discussion we will cover additional exercises, present and discuss the upcoming homework/laboratory assignments, and answer questions.  The first discussion session will introduce the logistics of the course. Laboratory sections begin starting  Monday, January 23  rd  . IMPORTANT:  To register for E7, you must be enrolled  in a laboratory section.  Also, you may only attend the laboratory section in which you are officially enrolled. 3. Teaching Staff Contact information for the course instructor and GSIs are given below. Professor  Reza Alam  (reza.alam@berkeley.edu), 6111  Etcheverry Hall. Office hours: MW 5pm-6pm Head GSI:  Qi Zheng  (  qizheng@berkeley.edu  ). Office hours: Tuesday 13:00 -14:00 and Wednesday 13:00 - 14:00. 5139 Etcheverry Hall (Administrative and grading matters pertaining to the course should be addressed to the Head GSI.) Minnie Chen (  minniechen@berkeley.edu  ) Dalmir Hasic (  dalmir@berkeley.edu  ) Xuan Hu (  xuan_hu@berkeley.edu  ) Prashant Pujari (  prashant_pujari@berkeley.edu  ) Caglar Tamur (  caglar.tamur@berkeley.edu  ) Haofu Xu (  cjstomxu@berkeley.edu  ) 4. E7 Course Websites E7 course website at bCourses The E7 course website is hosted at  bCourses  https://bcourses.berkeley.edu  (you can also access this site via calcentral.berkeley.edu).  bCourses is UC Berkeley’s instructional site (powered by Canvas). There you can find lecture slides, course announcements, homework and laboratory assignments, lecture notes and other course materials such as sample codes and videos. You are responsible for reviewing and reading announcements, homeworks, assignments, and other course materials. Each week, we will release the laboratory assignment over bCourses. You will also be provided with the assignment .pdf document & tempelated .m Matlab files for offline Matlab coding. You will have to input and submit your codes on bCourses Assignment by the assignment due date and time (Fridays 3 pm). You can submit your solutions for as many times as you wish before the deadline, but only your last submission grade will be recorded. Please note that it is NOT the highest score among the submissions that is recorded, but the  last submission  . E7 discussion website at Ed Discussion We have also set up an E7 discussion website at “Ed Discussion”. The E7 instructors and GSIs strongly encourage you to post technical questions on this site, as opposed to communicating with GSIs by private email.  The E7 instructors and GSIs will periodically visit this site and will attempt to respond to questions from students as quickly and accurately as possible. Links to unauthorized documents and direct answers to homework questions are not allowed. 5. Programming Language and Course Textbook The programming language of this offering of E7 is Matlab.  The E7 lab will be held in 203 - McLaughlin. We highly recommend (but do not require) that you obtain the latest Student Version of Matlab, which can be obtained (free) via UC Berkeley’s Software Central. There is no required textbook for this course  .  The  Matlab application has ample built-in help and tutorials; the same help and tutorials can be also found on the Mathworks web site, along with detailed manuals that you can download for free. There are numerous great textbooks on Matlab. we suggest exploring the library and online resources (e.g. google books, Amazon, etc) for the best one that matches your style. Few examples include: Applied Numerical Methods with Matlab (Custom) by Steven C. Chapra (any edition) MATLAB Primer, by Timothy A. Davis MATLAB: A Practical Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving by Stormy Attaway You are welcome to ask for the instructor’s opinion. 6. Laboratory Assignments There will be approximately 12 laboratory assignments (generally due every week).  All assignments must  be turned in no later than 3:00 pm on the Friday of the week they are due  . Here is some important information: (i) The procedure for working on your assignments will be explained during the Discussion Session on Friday, January 20th. Weekly laboratory assignments will be available for download (on Fridays) in the form of a PDF file. The auto-grader in bCourses will grade your work and will print out your scores for each problem and error information, if any. You can submit your solution files multiple times   until the deadline and only your last submission will be preserved. (ii) Owing to the size of the class, late assignments will not be accepted  under any circumstances.  We  will drop two of your lowest homework grades from the final grade calculation. For example, if for your assignments you receive all 100 but one 50 and one homework not submitted due to, say, a severe flue, then your homework grade that enters your final grade calculation will be 100 (because we drop your two lowest homework grades which are 50 and 0 for no submission.). This is to cover unexpected events or emergencies that you may face throughout the semester. Therefore, you do not need to contact us if you cannot turn in up to two homeworks. (iii) It is acceptable to discuss with your classmates the material contained in the assignments.  However, we require that you complete all assignments on your own.  Copying  someone else's work or allowing your work to be copied constitutes cheating and will result in  zero  credit  for the entire assignment  and  additional disciplinary action (see the Academic Honesty section below). List of labs Lab 011 Mon/Wed 12-14 pm: Dalmir Hasic, Haofu Xu Lab 012 Mon/Wed 10am-12 pm: Haofu Xu, Minnie Chen Lab 013 Mon/Wed 8-10 am: Minnie Chen Lab 014 Tue/Thu 8-10 am: Dalmir Hasic Lab 015 Tue/Thu 10am-12 pm: Caglar Lab 016 Tue/Thu 12-14 pm: Prashant Pujari Lab 017 Tue/Thu 14-16 pm: Xuan Hu Lab 018 Tue/Thu 16-18 pm: Xuan Hu Lab 019 Mon/Wed 18-20 pm: Caglar Lab 020 Tue/Thu 18-20 pm: Prashant Pujari 7. Midterms and Final Examinations There will be two 50-minute midterm examinations during the Friday discussion times.  The tentative dates  for the midterms are respectively March 3rd and April 7th, both from 4pm-5pm  .  There will be a 3-hour final examination on Friday, May 12, 8-11 am.  You will  be required to provide your ID before entering the examination rooms. ALL DATES ARE TENTATIVE. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FOLLOW CLASS, DISCUSSION SECTIONs AND BCOURSES ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THE LATEST UPDATES. If for a serious reason, you cannot make either of exams, it is your responsibility to send supporting documents at least 3 weeks before the exam, and discuss with the instructor whether an exception can be made. Because this is a crowded course, and to be fair to everyone, exceptions are rarely made. 8. Academic Honesty The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:  \"As a member of the UC  Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.\"  Your E7 instructors join you in pledging  to adhere to this code. Please note that copying programming code (even if it is only a portion of a larger program) constitutes cheating and we plan to deploy software that will detect when code has been copied. Cheating will result in a 0 on the assignment and a report submitted to The Center for Student Conduct. 9. Grades and Grading The course grade will be assigned based on the following percentages: 30%  Homework Assignments 15%  Midterm 1 20%  Midterm 2 35%  Final If you find any discrepancies between the issued grades and the grades posted on bCourses, please bring them to the attention of one of your laboratory GSIs immediately. Alternatively, you can visit the Head GSI's office hours. If you feel that a midterm problem is graded incorrectly, write a short paragraph outlining your stance and turn it to your laboratory GSI or the head GSI, along with the original examination. You have one week from the date that exams are first returned to submit a regrade request.  Any re-grades request submitted after the deadline will not be accepted. 10- Tentative Syllabus Course Introduction  Plotting; 3D Plots MATLAB as a calculator, scripts and cells and publish  Statistics (Histograms, Probability, Normal Distribution) Machine precision  Probability One-dimensional Arrays; Character Strings  Induction/Recursion Functions, User-defined and built-in functions  Linear Algebra (Intro and Matrix Methods) Function handles, anonymous functions  Midterm 2 Exam Subfunctions and nested functions  Basic Fitting; Regression, Interpolation Two-dimensional arrays;   polynomials  Numerical Differentiation Relational operators; logical operators; conditionals  Numerical Integration Definite and Conditional Loops  Ordinary Differential Equations Debugging,  Boundary Value Problems Midterm 1 Exam  Modeling engineering systems using differential equations Cell Arrays; Structure Arrays  Final Examination 10-1.

Instead, keep up with the class by borrowing notes from a friend, and reach out to GSIs and the instructor for help. Inclusion  : We are committed to creating an environment  welcoming of all students where everyone can fulfill their potential for learning. To do so, we intend to support a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respect each others’ identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this: ●  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by a lack of inclusion, please contact the instructors, an academic advisor, or the departmental Faculty Equity Advisor (  https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/faculty-equity-advisers/  ). An anonymous feedback form is also available at https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/  . ●  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s) or academic advisors in Engineering Student Services.  We want to be a resource for you. ●  There is no tolerance for sexual harassment or violence. If your behavior harms another person in this class, you may be removed from the class or the University either temporarily or permanently. ●  If you have a name and/or pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in the classroom at:  https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters  . ●  As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected. Collaboration  : You are encouraged to form study groups  and work together to understand course material, but all of your work submitted for a grade should be your own.  There are ways to make your work personal and unique even when it seems that there is only one way to correctly answer a question, and the instructors will support you in learning these methods. Collaboration is especially encouraged via the official online forum for this course, which includes everyone. Study Groups  : The official online forum for this course  is available through Ed Discussion. We ask that you use this whenever possible instead of informal tools such as group chats; doing so increases transparency and inclusion. We also remind you that it is especially important in these venues to choose your words carefully to ensure that you are supportive to your classmates and the instructional team. Student Conduct:  Ethical conduct is of utmost importance  in your education and career. The instructors, the College of Engineering, and U.C. Berkeley are responsible for supporting you by enforcing all students’ compliance with the Code of Student Conduct (  https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct  )  and the policies listed in the CoE Student Guide (https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/).  The Center for Student Conduct is your central source for guidance in these matters (https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). Incomplete Grades:  Incomplete grades must be resolved  in a timely manner in less than a year or will automatically lapse to an F grade. Exceptions to the timeline can be made in both directions (shorter or longer) according to the instructor’s judgment. The campus policy on incomplete grands can be reviewed here: https://registrar.berkeley.edu/faculty-staff/grading/incomplete-grades/ Accommodation policy:  We honor and respect the diversity  in our student body, and thus are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class.  If you need accommodations that provide equitable access, (e.g. religious observance, physical or mental health concerns, insufficient resources, etc.) please check  https://diversity.berkeley.edu/  and, if needed,  discuss with your specific case with the course instructor. 13- Resources For academic performance: The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence or CAEE (227 Bechtel Engineering Center; https://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/academic-support  )  is an inclusive center that offers study spaces, nutritious snacks, and tutoring in >50 courses for Berkeley engineers and other majors across campus.  The Center also offers a wide range of professional development, leadership, and wellness programs, and loans iclickers, laptops, and professional attire for interviews. For disability accommodations: The Disabled Student’s Program (DSP 260 César Chávez Student Center #4250; 510-642-0518; http://dsp.berkeley.edu  ) serves students with disabilities  of all kinds, including temporary disabilities (e.g., broken arm impacting ability to write). Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP's Specialists. If you have already been approved for accommodations through DSP, please know that DSP is ready to quickly adjust your accommodations if your situation changes. For mental wellbeing: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS,  https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps  )  is available as part of University Health Services (the Tang Center). Services are offered at many locations, including on-site in the College of Engineering (  https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/advising-counseling/counseling/  ).  CAPS services are available to all students, regardless of insurance, and initial visits do not cost anything.  CAPS has expanded allowing students to receive help immediately with same-day counseling (510-642-9494), online resources, and a 24/7 counseling line at (855) 817-5667.  Short-term help is also available from the Alameda County Crisis hotline: 800-309-2131.  If you, or someone you know, is experiencing an emergency that puts their health at risk, please call 911. For basic needs (food, shelter, etc): The Basic Needs Center provides housing, food, transportation support, among other support needed to thrive at UC Berkeley.  https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/  Specifically,  t  he UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union;  https://pantry.berkeley.edu  )  aims to  reduce food insecurity among students, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements.  The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support. For solving a dispute: The Ombudsperson for Students (102 Sproul Hall; 642-5754;  http://students.berkeley.edu/Ombuds  )  provides a confidential service for students in need of a neutral party to resolve University-related disputes (academic or administrative). The Ombudsman can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students' contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault: The Care Line or the PATH to Care Center (510-643-2005;  https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/  ) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting. 14- Programming Practice Resources 1- The list here is an unofficial list of resources that may help you with more practice problems.

A variety of good manuals on AutoCAD are available from  amazon.com and  the many bookstores around campus, and may be used as reference material for those with little or no CAD experience. Organization : 15 weeks of lecture.  Homework will be assigned weekly in lecture will be due in class before lecture begins the following week.  The midterm examination  is scheduled for the evening ( 7:00 – 9:00 PM) of Friday, 6 March .  Availability for lectures, laboratories, and all examinat ions is required for enrollment in the class. Laboratory : The purpose of the laboratory is to provide a forum where students can receive assistance with lecture and homework material from the instructors and other students.  At the beginnin g of each lab session, the GSI will usually present a short review of the week's lecture material, and provide useful hints for the homework assignment that week .  The GSI will also provide a series of exercises to be done during the lab period. Attendance of the lab i s mandatory and will be checked by submission of the lab exercises. The labs are locked after 6:00 PM and on the weekends and the building is locked at 7:00 PM and on weekends; however, students enrolled in the class can obtain card key activation to ac cess the labs and the building after hours with the proximity card key feature of their student ID. Card key activation may be obtained from https://www.me.berkeley.edu/accounttool/ for a $10 activation fee (through CARS) if you are an ME student. Otherwis e you can get card key access with $10 check or money order to UC Regents, from room 6161 Etcheverry during key hours (9 AM to 11 AM Tu -Fri). The CAD workstations in rooms 10 Jacobs Hall and 1171  Etcheverry Hall are provided for  student use in this, and o ther courses, except when a class is in session.  The student stations in each laboratory are networked to a printer and a fileserver, where personal files (up to 1 Gb) may be stored.  Each student can use their CalNet ID (student ID) and their passphrase to logon to the computers   Only students who are on the official class list AND have their card key activated will be allowed to login. There will be a grace period of three  weeks from the start of the semester before students without cardkeys activation will be denied access. Sometimes actual activation gets delayed, but as long as you have signed up for activation your computer account will remain active. Each student shoul d obtain a USB drive for file transfer and back -up.   Many homework assignments and the project will require the use of a computer.  It is recommended that students use their own computers and software for doing their homework and project outside the labor atory.  The software used for this c ourse is AutoCAD  2020, which is available at no cost for students .  Instructions for downloading the software will be given during Lab. If problems are encountered with a machine  in the Lab , place a note under the keyboa rd describing the problem, and move to another machine; otherwise the instructors will not know  that a machine is down.

Weekly laboratory and homework assignments All labs will be live via Zoom. The lab period is 2 hours. During the labs, students will start by doing step-by-step solid modeling tutorials to learn different functionality. Then they will be given the lab assignment where they will apply what they’ve learned to model new geometries, assemblies, and products. There will be a focus on learning how to build a solid model to capture design intent and meaningful dependencies for ease of subsequent editing (project). You should be able to finish most of the lab assignment during the lab. If not, you must finish it before coming to the lab the following week (see due dates on syllabus or bCourse).  Students will also learn how to set up for a 3D-print build, and 3D-print a geometry they design themselves. Homework problems will cover the theory behind the software, such as constraints and Booleans, and additional modeling problems that build on skills acquired during lab. Lab assignments are due on Tuesdays by 11:59 pm. The due dates are indicated in the course syllabus and on bCourse. Academic Honesty All students should be familiar with the Code of Student Conduct and know that the general rules and students rights stated in the document apply to this class (see http://uga.berkeley.edu/SAS/osc.htm ). With regard to laboratory work and homework assignments, not only are you allowed, but you are encouraged, to discuss the problems and techniques with other students; but each student must do his or her version of the solution. Submitting someone else’s work as your own or knowingly allowing someone else to turn in your work as their own will result in a zero grade for the assignment for all involved and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Cheating on the examinations will result in a failing grade in the course and your action will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for administrative review. ********************************************** Zoom Classroom Etiquette If possible have your webcam on during the lecture. Or at least have your picture as the background. The webcam is required for the final exam .  Position Your Camera Properly: Be sure your webcam is in a stable position and focused at eye level. Mute Your Microphone: To help keep background noise to a minimum, make sure you mute your microphone when you are not speaking. Be Mindful of Background Noise and Distractions: Find a quiet place to “attend” class, to the greatest extent possible. ○ Avoid video setups where people may be walking behind you, people talking/making noise, etc. ○ Avoid activities that could create additional noise, such as shuffling papers, listening to music in the background, etc. Limit Your Distractions/Avoid Multitasking: You can make it easier to focus on the meeting by turning off notifications, closing or minimizing running apps, and putting your smartphone away (unless you are using it to access Zoom). Use Appropriate Virtual Backgrounds: If using a virtual background, it should be appropriate and professional and should NOT suggest or include content that is objectively offensive or demeaning. Make sure your name and your picture is displayed. Technical difficulties Internet connection issues : Canvas (bCourse) autosaves responses a few times per minute as long as there is an internet connection. If your internet connection is lost, Canvas will warn you but allow you to continue working on your exam. A brief loss of internet connection is unlikely to cause you to lose your work. However, a longer loss of connectivity or weak/unstable connection may jeopardize your exam. Other technical difficulties : Immediately email the instructor a current copy of the state of your work/exam and explain the problem you are facing. Your instructor may not be able to respond immediately or provide technical. Course Policies Inclusion: We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: ●If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let us know. ●If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us.  We want to be resources for you. ●We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. You may also contact the ME department’s Vice Chair for Equity & Inclusion, Professor Grace O’Connell (g.oconnell@berkeley.edu ) or Staff Student Services for Equity and Inclusion, Ricky Vides ( rickyv72@berkeley.edu ). For ME specific resources for Equity & Inclusion please visit our website: https://me.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/ ●As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected. Berkeley honor code : Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to this code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” Academic honesty : You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material, but all written work and CAD models as well as responses to in-class questions should be your own.  You may not copy other students’ work. Academic integrity and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at U.C. Berkeley. Accommodation policy: We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class.  If you need religious or disability-related accommodations, if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with us, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please share this information with us as soon as possible. You may speak with either instructor privately after class or during office hours.  Also see DSP under “Resources”.

Counseling and Psychological Services The main University Health Services Counseling and Psychological Services staff is located at the Tang Center ( http://uhs.berkeley.edu ; 2222 Bancroft Way; 642-9494) and provides confidential assistance to students managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in 241 Bechtel Engineering Center (check here for schedule: https://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising-counseling ). The Care Line (PATH to Care Center) The Care Line (510-643-2005; https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/ ) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting. Ombudsperson for Students The Ombudsperson for Students (102 Sproul Hall; 642-5754; http://students.berkeley.edu/Ombuds )  provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsman can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students' contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsman, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm. UC Berkeley Food Pantry The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union; https://pantry.berkeley.edu  )   aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements.   The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

Lectures up until March 4 remain available  on Cal Central: https://calcentral.berkeley.edu . If you are registered for E27, the class will appear under “My Classes” and the videos under “Course Captures” on the right hand side of the E27 class page. In case of any technical issues  in accessing the recordings, please contact Educational Technology Services via the web form at https://www.ets.berkeley.edu/find -support/request -forms/general -support - request -or-give-feedback . 5 Laboratories Locations Week -by-week l ocations for lab sessions are detailed in the schedule above . Labs begin in the week of January  27th. All laboratories are online until further notice . Sections There will be  ten lab sections , each led by the GSI indicated : Section #  Day Times  Lab “block”  Usual location  GSI 101 Monday  1–3pm A Jacobs 10C  Cody 102 Monday  3–5pm A Jacobs 210  Gideon 103 Thursday  9–11am  A Jacobs 210  Ninh 104 Wednesday  3–5pm A Jacobs 220  Brian 105 Monday  3–5pm B Jacobs 220  Brian 106 Thursday  9–11am  B Jacobs 10C  Cody 107 Wednesday  3–5pm B Jacobs 10C  Gideon 108 Tuesday  9–11am  A Jacobs 210 Ninh 109 Thursday  3–5pm B Jacobs 220  Gideon 110 Tuesday  9–11am  B Jacobs 10C  Cody Note : Gideon is away in week 2 and other GSIs will stand in for him then. If you need to  change sections  or need to find space in a specific section in order to take the class , please contact one of the GSIs. Although , in the scheduling system, the labs are noted as being three hours long, we have designed the labs to take two hours, and we only require attendance during one of the weekly two -hour periods noted above . However, we do have the room for a full third hour in each case, so you are welcome to stay and continue working with your team if desired. In the start -of-semester survey, you can let us know if you have any lab scheduling conflicts with other classes, and we will try to fine -tune lab capacity and enroll ment to resolve as many of these conflicts as possible: https://forms.gle/WvhN2UWqC3qKwCjg6 Jacobs Hall Maker Pass We will make extensive use of  Jacobs Hall, for which a Maker Pass is required.  The Jacobs Hall Maker Pass fee is $ 100 for the semester . Payment can be made online or by check and details are at: http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/our -space/makerpa ss/get -maker - pass/ . Fee waivers are available to students with financial need and are requestable during the sign -up process. 6 Lab groups We ask you  to form teams of 3–5 people which will last for the whole semester and in which you will work during all the laboratory sessions. Feel free to identify potential group members in advance of the first lab session; in addition, t he first 15 minutes of the first lab session will be allo cated to find ing team members. We recommend that you try to form teams with at least one person who has a good working knowledge of a 3D CAD package such as Solidworks  or Fusion 360 , and at least one person who knows some Matlab. We ask that you use bCou rses to create a group containing your team -members under the tab “Lab teams (self -organize here)” tab in the “People” section of the class site. Please do this by the end of Monday 2/3 and give your team a name of your choice; after that, we will freeze t he groups’ composition so that you can use them to upload assignments as a team. If you need to change teams after 2/3, please contact your GSI. Pre-lab preparation Each lab session will have an associated handout which will be posted on bCourses before the lab session begins. Please download this handout, and read it through carefully before your scheduled lab session . Please also bring along the lab handout, either in printed form or on a screen that you can view  while working . Lab deliverables Most  lab session s will have certain tasks you have to complete and questions that are to be discussed with your lab -mates and then answered.  For some  labs, a short written re port will be required.  You will work with your team -mates to do the practical work, discuss the questions, and produce a joint report  from your team.  Some guidance on writing lab reports for E27 is available under Files>Labs in bCourses, in the file “E27 S 20 Lab write -up guidance notes.pdf”. Knowing that some teams will want a little extra time to put the finishing touches to their lab reports, we are setting a deadline for submission of the report, when required, that falls a little over a week  after the lab session takes place. We ask you to upload lab reports to bCourses  as a group submission . A scan of a (legible) handwritten report is absolutely fine. Each  group report needs to feature all team -members’ names on the first page and  to include a short par agraph listing  the contributions of each team -member. All team members must have an opportunity to review  the report’s contents before the report is uploaded. Lab report uploads will be based on the team compositions  supplied  by you in bCourses  by February 3, so that only one copy of each report will need to be uploaded per team. In case of any concerns or disagreements about the content of a lab report that your team has prepared, please discuss them with your team in the fir st instance, and then contact your GSI if they cannot be resolved. Your final score for lab deliverables will constitute 3 5% of the total class grade (see “Grading” below), and will be made up as follows: 7 Report topic  Proportion of class  grade Lab 1 (Consumer product  reverse engineering)  4% Lab 2  (Redesign of  Stirling engine flywheel)  4% Labs 4, 6&8 (Project motivation , design,  and process selection ) 10% Lab 5 (Dimensional measurements and variability)  4% Lab 7 (Injection molding dimensional variability analysis)  3% Final project poster and design project prototype  10% Total  35% Drop -in lab  opportunities The manufactured products  that you will analyze in Lab 1 , including  the Stirling engines , will be made available in Jacobs for use outside of the scheduled lab hours , in case you wish to check details or dimensions for any of your assignments.  Generally we will store these items on the shelves in Jacobs 210. If you cannot find them please cont act your GSI. Safety  and training Please carefully read  and sign the document “ Instructional Laboratory and Student Shop Safety Guidelines ” that is posted on bCourses  under Files -> Labs , and hand it to your GSI.  You can print it in advance, but copies wil l also be available in lab for you to sign. Also, we need you to complete General Workshop Safety Training  for Jacobs Hall by 1/27: http://gws.jacobshall.org/  . Please note that by 1/ 27 only the GWS training  is required . There  is a subsequent deadline on 2/ 14 for at least one team -member to be trained on the Universal Systems  laser cutters (for polymers and plywood) and one team -member on  either the OMAX waterjet cutter  or the Fab Light metal laser cut ter (including the hands -on training) . There is also a deadline on 3/ 20 for at least one team -member to have done the online training for t he Type A  or Ultimaker  3D printers  (hands -on training  is optional for using these printers ). There are t wo key things to be aware of for any lab session tha t takes place anywhere in Hesse , in Jacobs,  or in Etcheverry 1166 : 1. Please ensure that you have safety glasses by 2/ 10 (for the Machine Shop tour) . You are required to bring your own safety glasses  and wear them whenever indicated by signs or by staff . These can be purchased, for example, from the Cal Student Store at 2495  Bancroft Way, or from Ace Hardware at 2020 Milvia St , Berkeley. 2. No sho rts/skirts or o pen-toe footwear are allowed in the labs. Legs and toes must be covered to protect them. Safety guidelines will require us to send you home to change if you do not follow these guidelines.  In exceptional circumstances, the Hesse lab staff may be able to su pply safety glasses to students who are able to pay using a CARS account, but this will need to be 8 arranged in advance of the lab because there will not be time to supply glasses at the start of a lab session. Homeworks Homeworks will be due by 11:59pm on the Wednesday  of the week they are due. Homework questions  will be released on bCourses at least one week, and usually longer , before the due date.  Your responses will be due on Gradescope  in the format indicated in the homework assignment. Solutions will be posted a few days after the deadline and well in advance of exams . We aim to return graded homework within two weeks  of submission. Final exam The final exam is scheduled to take place on Tuesday  5/12/20, 8–11am. This will be a cumulative  exam that will test material from throughout the class.  If you have a conflict with an exam for another class or would have three or more exams on 5/12, please complete this survey so I can look for a solution: https://forms.gle/QAss5Ut8aQNWcVoBA I plan to offer the f inal exam  online , released 5/11, 8am PDT; due 5/13 8am PDT  on Gradescope . If the Univ ersity te lls me I have to change this plan I will let you know. Field trips We will be organizing a number of optional field trips to visit local manufacturing companies. More details on how to sign up for them will be made available soon. Additionally , there are some  slots available in a 1 -unit, P/NP class  called  Des Inv 97: Manufacturing Field Trips . This class provides credit for attending five trips over the course of the semester and writing a brief reflection in blog format after one or more of them . About an extra 15 slots are available for E27 students; if you would like to join Des Inv 97, please e -mail me (Hayden) on hkt@berkeley.edu  before midnight on Sunday January 26th to let me know this, and I will register as many people as possible. You only need to sign up for Des Inv 97 if you want the extra unit of credit; there will be some slots available on individual field trips for those who are registered only in E27. Field trips are postponed until further noti ce. Reference books There is no required course text book and all the material you need to succeed in E27 will be included in the lecture slides, homeworks, laboratory handouts and in additional materials that will be posted on bCourses. Books for possible supplementary read ing include: • Visualization, Modeling and Graphics for Engineering Design  by D. Lieu and S. Sorby, Delmar Cengage Publishing , ISBN 978 -1-4018 -4249 -9. Library call number: TA174.L54 2009  (there are several copies available on one -week loan). This text has very thorough coverage of tolerancing in Chapter 16 . Please note that there are abri dged versions of the book that d o not cover tolerancing. 9 For more in -depth coverage of manufacturing processes, see: • Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing: Materials, Proc esses, and Systems , by M.P. Groover, Wiley. ISBN 978-1-1182 -3146 -3. Library call number: TS183 .G78 2013 . Concise coverage of manufacturing processes. There is a PDF version online at https://futureingscientist.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/fundamentals -of-modern - manufacturing -4th-edition -by-mikell -p-groover.pdf . • Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials , by S. Kalpakjian and S. Schmid, 5th Edition, Prentice  Hall. ISBN 978 -0132272711. Library call number : TS183 .K34 2008 . Additional reading that may be of interest includes: • The Perfectionists : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World , by S. Winche ster, HarperCollins ISBN 978 -0062652560. Library call number: TA19 .W56 2018 . • Faster,  Better,  Cheaper  in the History of Manufacturing: From the Stone Age to Lean Manufacturing and Beyond , by C. Roser, Taylor and Francis, 2016. Online: http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b23592486~S1 Grading Students will receive a letter grade for this course, composed in the following way: • Home works: 2 0% • Take -home  midterm  (week 10 ): 10% • Final exam: 25% • Laboratory and project reports: 35 % • Active and cons tructive participation in labs* : 10% * In establishing the participation score, we will take into account the rel iable and timely completion of any prelabs  and the Learning Styles I nventory and teaming surveys that will be sent to you several days before they are due . For the initial and mid -term surveys (due 3/1 and 4/3 respectively), you will receive credit for completing  the surveys but your grade will not be dependent on the scores you receive from team -mates. For the final survey (due 5/10), however, your grade may be influenced by how your team -mates rate your contribution.  The idea is to encourage frank and constructi ve mid -term feedback to be given , enabling ‘course -correction ’ by team members , but still to motivate engagement in team -work as the projects near completion. Your participation score can also be positively influenced by  any constructive  interactions with the teaching staff  about class material , e.g. in class, office hours and lab sessions. Academic integrity We will be adhering to the Berkeley Honor Code ( http://asuc.org/honorcode/index.php ). If anyone has any questions about the responsibilities they have as part of this Code, please contact the course instructor. 10 Lateness and illness Laboratory sessions are an integral part of this class and ar e considered compulsory . However, if you fall ill w e would prefer you to rest so that you can get better as soon as possible.  If you fall ill or experience exceptional circumstances, p lease contact your GSI to arrange an alternative time to complete the relevant lab work, homework, or assessment once you h ave recovered. The fact that Jacobs is open long ho urs will help people to make up lab work. We will not be requiring written excuses from medical personnel. For labs to run smoothly we encourage you to make every effort to arrive promptly at the start of your lab session, and certainly no later than 10 minutes after its scheduled start time. We do ask that you try to complete assignments by the deadlines. We will be accommodating of occasional slightly late assignment completion, but may penalize frequent  or egregious lateness. Please make sure you communicate with your GSI if for any reason you think you need more time for an assignment. A note about the Student Machine Shop and training Student Machine Shop orientation is not part of the E27 syllabus . We appreciate that many students would like to become trained in the Machine Shop. As you are probably aware, demand for access to the shop is extremely high and is growing — the Shop currently trains ~400 people/year.  The Shop staff is currently working at full capacity. As a result, when we were planning E27 we agreed not to include automatic Shop training  in the syllabus. In response to the strong demand for Shop access , I secured a grant from Berkeley's Center for Teaching and Learn ing to begin to move some of the safety/orientation training online and thus hopefully increase the number of people it is possible to train to use the shop. Training materials for lathe turning , resulting from this project, will form part of the homework on subtractive manufacturing.

This course explores historical and contemporary experiences of Black , Indigenous , European American, Asian American, and Latinx communities in relation to natural resources.  We start with the contention that natural resource management i s premised upon historically and culturally distinct relationships between humans , natur e, and associated social and economic systems .  These, in turn, are conditioned by struggles between individual s, groups, and institutions over access to and control of  land, water and other resources.  We focus on political economy, property, ecology, identity, and narrative to investigate complex relationships between humans and nature, and how these have influenced urban and rural social life and landscapes.  For inst ance, we examine how racial difference has shaped American Indian rights to and management of forest resources in northern California, Chinese American access to farmland in the California Delta, social and environmental histories in the East Bay, and dive rgent experiences of New Orleans residents before, during and after Hurricane Katrina. Learning objectives.  ESPM 50AC offers students a range of learning experiences by integrating research, public engagement, and creativity in an interdisciplinary curriculum. This course is designed to facilitate students’ understanding of the following: • Relationshi ps between natural resource management and race in the U.S. • Policy and ethical dimensions of natural resource management • Critical understanding of identity and power relations in the U.S. Additionally, this course is designed to cultivate students ’ interests and abilities in the following: • Holistic, systems -based, and multi -disciplinary approaches to complex phenomena • Critical thinking, reading and analysis • Short essay writing and group project work • Understanding one’s own experiences, ro les and actions in society • Informed, critical, creative and self -reflective civic engagement 2  Remote education.

Grading.   There is no curve for this class.   An A grade is 95% of the point value of any given assignment (e.g., an A grade for an assignment worth 40 points is 38/40).  We rarely give grades  above an A for assignments and class participation.  Your final grade is based on a 1000 -point system, with the following point value grade breakdown: A+  =   1000 A    =   920-999 A-   =   900-919 B+  =   880-899 B    =   820-879  B-   =   800-819 C+  =   780 -799 C    =   720-779 C-   =   700-719 D+  =   680-699     D    =    620-679 D-   =   600-619 F     =   < 600 P/NP =   700 Grade expectations, rubrics and standards :  If you complete all reading and assignments at a reasonably high level of quality and actively engage in section, you will earn at least a B, and quite possibly an A for the semester.  Most assignments have a rubric that will be used by GSIs and be availab le to students. Beyond the specifics of particular assignment rubrics, grading is based on the quality of the following, per the instructions for each specific assignment: • Writing (or other form of presentation) content • Writing (or other form of presenta tion) form • Understanding of the material • Conceptualization and argument • Depth of thought, creativity, etc. • Organization and formatting • Use of appropriate sources • Clear demonstration of appropriate effort and time -commitment • Following the assignment guidelines and responding appropriately to the prompt Tracking your grade :  BCourses is NOT set up to track your final grade, so please don’t contact us to inform us  that your grade percentages appears  incorrect in bCourses (unless, of course, there is a data entry mistake in one of your assignment scores).

Campus -wide policies regarding reproduction of class materials and notes are clearly stated in this document .  Our greatest concern is that you refrain from sharing course material on course note sharing and selling sites such as Course Hero.   These sites are often used in a way that may undermine engaged, critical understanding of course material. If you post course material to one of these sites you will be asked to remove it immediately, and you may suffer a grade penalty at the discretion of the instructor.  If you share any course materials with a person or enterprise for compensation , you  will receive an F for th e semester. Academic Integrity and Plagiarism.  Plagiarism is a BIG problem at UC Berkeley.  While some students purposefully plagiarize by submitting purchased term papers or failing to cite sources, etc., many others simply don’t understand proper referencing of ideas and information.  See the UC Berkeley Library Citation  Guide for guidance on avoiding plagiarism.  Additionally, self -plagiarism, submitting your own work from another course or context without citing it, is not allowed.  If you are uncertain about whether you have plagiarized, check with your GSI before  submi tting.  And understand that we use Turnitin plagiarism detection software for bCourses submissions. 9  UNIT I:  HURRICANE KATRINA AND BLACK COMMUNITIES IN NEW ORLEANS This unit introduces subjects that frame our study of culture, race and natu ral resource management in the course.  First, we discuss concepts associated with the American Cultures requirement.  Then we set the stage for understanding historical relationships between resource use and the experiences of different racial groups by examining social relations, ecosystems, and infrastructure development in New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina.  We emphasize that culture and nature are not separate but shape one another.  And we explore power  relations, property rights and visions of the social contract.

Cheating is a form of academic dishonesty: “Cheating is defined as fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in an academic assignment, or using or attempting to use materials, or assisting others in using materials which are prohibited or inappropriate in the context of the academic assignment in question.” ( Academic Honesty: A Guide for Students, p.3) EXAMPLES OF CHEATING INCLUDE (but ar e not limited to):  Copying or attempting to copy from others during an exam or on an assignment.  Communicating answers with another person during and/or after an exam.  Writing answers on a desk before an exam.  Allowing others to do an assignment or portio n of an assignment for you.  Collaborating on an exam or assignment with any other person without prior approval from the instructor.  Taking an exam for another person or having someone take an exam for you. 12. Class rules J1A is a fun course and we hope you will enjoy studying Japanese with us. There are a few rules for class we want you to observe in order to learn more and enjoy in class. 1) RESPECT for your instructor and your fellow students is very important. Respect and support for each other will create a better lea rning  environment. We will have a lot of pair work  in class . Please be respectful and c ooperate with your classmates as well as your instructor . 2) Preparation and reviewing are required. You are expected to study  two hours every day  for review and preview for the class. Please make sure to memorize vocabulary, and read each lesson in the textbook beforehand , so that you will have an idea of what we will be covering during a given week.  This is very important because the instructor will NOT explain grammar in English during class . You are expected to review the materials covered in class every day  and make sure you understand them. The longer you put off reviewing, the more difficult it will be to catch up. 3) Class participation is important. Make sure you understand usages of grammar points and vocabulary in class by answering questions in class. Don’t be afraid of giving a wrong answer. Wrong answers are welcomed because everybody in your class can feel comfortable to do the same and learn more. 4) Eating in class is NOT allowed, including chewing gum and candy. If you need to eat during class hours, please do so outside of classroom. 5) Be sure to turn off your cell phones and laptops and other electronic dev ices and put them in your bag when you enter the classroom. 6) If you wear a cap, hat or hood in class, make sure that your face is visible while you take quizzes. 13.

Students should listen to the exercises and submit answers by 9:00 AM on the due dates. You can do the exercises as many times as you wish and submit by the due dates. The highest score will be recorded as your final score. See the schedule for due dates.  Note: There may be times when bCourses is inaccessible. Start your homework well before the due dates.  3) Composition Homework You will write an essay of 600-800 character length about your friends, family, favorite place, trip, etc. using the sentence structures, vocabulary and Kanji you have learned. Details will be announced later.  6. Extra Practice  There are some self-study materials for your own practice on bCourses. Although it will not be included in your final grade, similar questions may appear on the tests. There are two kinds of self-study materials: paper (for grammar) and bCourses (for grammar, Kanji, and listening). Click lesson number on the home page, and find them under “Self-study”.  *Please use these helpful study materials to improve your Japanese!   7. Quizzes  There will be vocabulary quizzes, oral quizzes, listening quizzes, written quizzes and oral interview.   1) Vocabulary Quizzes (“VQ” on the schedule) There will be a short vocabulary quiz in the first hour of each lesson. Students should study the new vocabulary list in the textbook for these quizzes. Please be sure to arrive in class ten minutes after the hour for the quiz.   2) Oral Quizzes (skits) (“OQ” on the schedule) There will be 5 oral quizzes. The students will write, memorize and act out a short skit with a partner. Detailed instructions will be given later.   3) Listening Quizzes (“LQ” on the schedule) There will be 5 listening quizzes. Japanese\t1B\tSyllabus\tSpring\t2021 3  4) Written Quizzes (“WQ” on the schedule) There will be a written quiz, usually every other Friday.  In this quiz, the students’ progress in kanji, grammar, writing and reading comprehension skills will be evaluated. 5) Oral interview (Tentatively scheduled on April 23, 26, and 27) Details will be announced later.    Note:  a) All the score of quizzes will be included in computing the final grade.  b) You are required to take quizzes in the section to which you are assigned. Otherwise, quizzes will not be graded.  c) No make-up will be given for any quiz.  8. Attendance \tAttendance is essential in this course, and you are expected to attend class every day. However, unpredictable events (e.g. an accident, conference presentation, family emergency, illness, job interview) may occur. Therefore, you are allowed up to five discretionary absences during the semester without grade penalty. One percentage point will be taken off the final grade for each absence over five. If you need longer absences due to hospitalization, an overseas job interview, etc., you must consult the instructor immediately.       You are expected to arrive to class on time and stay until the end of the class period. Three        late arrivals or early departures (by five minutes or more) will be considered as one absence.        Missing more than 15 minutes will also count as one absence.   There will be absolutely no make-ups for any quizzes or presentations you miss because of absence(s). The total possible points of the activity (a quiz or presentation) will be adjusted to calculate the final grade if your activity day absence is excused.   Accommodation of religious creed will be made according to the University policy: https://sa.berkeley.edu/uga/religion  9. Grading Scale   Attendance ........................................5% Oral Quizzes ................................... 5%  Class participation .............................3% Listening Quizzes ........................... 5%  Homework .......................................22% Written Quizzes ........................... 45%  Vocabulary Quizzes ........................10% Oral Interview ................................ 5%  Note: The final grades will be calculated carefully according to the above grading scale. Once they are assigned, they are FINAL and NOT NEGOTIABLE.  10. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities  If you have been issued a letter of accommodation from the Disabled Students Program (DSP), please contact the instructor as soon as possible to work out the necessary Japanese\t1B\tSyllabus\tSpring\t2021 4  arrangements. If you need an accommodation and have not yet seen a Disability Specialist at the DSP, please do so as soon as possible.   11. Academic Integrity  You have pledged to abide by the UC Berkeley honor code as a UC Berkeley student, “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”  The EALC faculty and advisors expect that students will abide by the standards of academic honesty outlined in the Student Code of Conduct. Incidences of academic dishonesty in EALC classes, when they are discovered, will be reported to Office of Student Conduct.  Students found responsible for academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions including a failing grade, community service, academic probation, or suspension.   It is important that you familiarize yourself with these guidelines, “Student Guide to Academic Integrity at Cal,” which is available from Student Judicial Affairs, 326 Sproul Hall or Code of Conduct, The Center for Student Conduct at http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp.  The guidelines state that academic dishonesty is any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community.   Cheating is a form of academic dishonesty:  “Cheating is defined as fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in an academic assignment, or using or attempting to use materials, or assisting others in using materials which are prohibited or inappropriate in the context of the academic assignment in question.” (Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct p.26)  EXAMPLES OF CHEATING INCLUDE (but are not limited to):   • Copying or attempting to copy from others during an exam or on an assignment. • Communicating answers with another person during (and/or after) an exam. • Writing answers on a desk before an exam. • Allowing others to do an assignment or portion of an assignment for you. • Collaborating on an exam or assignment with any other person. • Taking an exam for another person or having someone take an exam for you.  12. Class Rules  J1B is a fun course and I hope you will enjoy studying Japanese together. There are a few rules for class I want you to observe in order to learn more and enjoy the class.   1) RESPECT for your instructor and your fellow students is very important. Respect and support for each other will create a better learning environment. Japanese\t1B\tSyllabus\tSpring\t2021 5  We will have a lot of pair/group work in class. Please be respectful and cooperate with your classmates as well as your instructor.   2) Preparation and reviewing are required. You are expected to study two hours every day for review and preview for the class. Please make sure to memorize vocabulary, and read each lesson in the textbook beforehand, so that you will have an idea of what we will be covered during a given week. This is very important because the instructor will NOT explain grammar in English during class. You are expected to review the materials covered in class every day and make sure you understand them. The longer you put off reviewing, the more difficult it will be to catch up.  3) Class participation is important. Make sure you understand usages of grammar points and vocabulary in class by answering questions in class. Don’t be afraid of giving a wrong answer. Wrong answers are welcomed because everybody in your class can feel comfortable to do the same and learn more. Please note that doing homework during class is considered not participating in class activities.  4) Eating during class is NOT allowed, including chewing gum and candy.  5) Be sure to turn off your cell phones and laptops and other electronic devices and put them in your bag when you enter the classroom.  6) If you wear a hat or cap in class, make sure that your face is visible while you take quizzes.   13. Online rules and etiquette     ＊Checking your technical equipment and learning environment • Organize your learning environment. • Check your Wi-Fi network beforehand. • Connect a few minutes early. • Adjust your webcam to ensure other participants can see you. • Avoid background noise. Mute mic when you are outside or there is noise around you.  • You may want to use a headset to reduce background noise and other distractions.     ＊Communicating during your online class • Follow the typical classroom rules, be patient, collaborative, listen to others, be respectful, and be open-minded. • Allow time for your classmates to ask questions and finish speaking. • Respect everyone’s opinion/their backgrounds and perspectives (The Golden Rules).  14. Harassment and Discrimination  Please see bCourses for information."

The overall objectives are to provide students with a basic working understanding of materials, in support of a career as a practicing engineer. The course provides broad coverage of the field for non-majors who may not take another course in materials science & engineering, and it serves as the introductory course in the major field, laying the foundation for understanding the relationship between the internal structure of matter and the properties of materials that make them attractive for practical applications. This course will apply basic principles of physics and chemistry to the engineering properties of materials. Primary emphasis will be devoted to the structure-properties-processing relationships of metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites, and principles of materials selection.

You will be allowed to drop the lowest grade. Submit homework in either pdf format or as photographs of handwritten work. No word-processing file formats will be accepted. It is strongly suggested to use word-processing software with an appropriate equation-editor. If you choose to hand write your answers and your handwriting is illegible, points will be taken off.  You are allowed to work together with one other student to solve homework problems if you wish.  If you choose to do this, then the exact same document (with both names on it) must be submitted by both students. Both students will receive the same grade. Homework sets that contain similar solutions that fall outside of these guidelines will lead to additional scrutiny and may be considered academic dishonesty. You may not use solutions to questions that are available from websites, various student organizations that maintain databases from previous years, or those provided to you by your friends. If you do this you are engaging in plagiarism.  Exams   There will be three 50-minute exams, occurring on February 12, March 10 and April 9. The final exam will take place on Wednesday May 12 from 3-6PM PST. The final exam will be cumulative – covering all topics from the entire course, but emphasizing the content in lectures after Exam 3.   Late Assignments  Because of the drop policy, no late homework will be accepted except for the following circumstances. These include a medical condition that prevents completion of the assignment, deaths in the family, jury duty, etc. Plan ahead and avoid submitting at the deadline: “My internet service crashed 5 minutes before the deadline so I could not submit my assignment on time” will not be accepted as an excuse.   Re-grading Policy  Re-grade requests must be submitted by email to Professor Messersmith within one week of score posting. Submit a clear and detailed written description of why you think it merits a re-grade, using complete sentences, punctuation and no SMS/social media abbreviations. LOL! THX! Simple fixes such as addition errors will be corrected immediately. Note that a request for a regrade does not guarantee a change in grade, and that re-grading may uncover previously undetected errors on other problems that could change your grade. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA        Mat Sci 45 - Properties of Materials Department of Materials Science & Engineering           Spring 2021  Support during Remote Learning  We understand that your specific situation may present challenges to class participation. Please contact the instructors if you would like to discuss these and co-develop strategies for engaging with the course.   • The Student Technology Equity Program (STEP) is available to help access a laptop, Wi-Fi hotspot, and other peripherals (https://technology.berkeley.edu/STEP). • You will be alerted as to when synchronous sessions are about to be recorded. There is a verbal alert when the instructor/GSI begins the session. If you join subsequently you will not hear the alert but should assume that the session is being recorded. If you prefer not to be recorded, you may turn your video and microphone off. • Please set your Zoom name to be the name you would like the instructors to call you. You may optionally include your personal pronouns.  • Please set your Zoom picture to an appropriate profile picture of you to foster a sense of community and enhance interactions. If you are not comfortable using an image of yourself, you may use an appropriate picture of an avatar. • We encourage participating with your video on to foster a sense of community and enhance interactions. However, we understand that some students are not comfortable with video or may not be able to participate by video.  Accommodation Policy We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class.  If you need accommodations for any reason (e.g. religious observance, health concerns, insufficient resources, etc.) please discuss with your instructor or academic advisor how to best support you.  We will respect your privacy under state and Federal laws, and you will not be asked to share more than you are comfortable sharing.  The disabled student program is a related resource.  Inclusion We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students. To do so, we intend to support a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respect each others’ identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this: ● If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by a lack of inclusion, please contact the instructors, your ESS advisor, or the departmental Faculty Equity Advisor (list and information at: https://diversity.berkeley.edu/faculty-equity-advisors).  An anonymous feedback form is also available at https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/.  ● If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in the classroom at: https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters. ● If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s).  We want to be resources for you. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA        Mat Sci 45 - Properties of Materials Department of Materials Science & Engineering           Spring 2021  ● We are all in the process of learning how to respect and include diverse perspectives and identities. Please take care of yourself and those around you as we work through the challenging but important learning process. ● As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected.     Academic Code of Conduct Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to Berkeley Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”   Ethical conduct is of utmost importance in your education and career. The instructors, the College of Engineering, and U.C. Berkeley are responsible for supporting you by enforcing all students’ compliance with the Code of Student Conduct and the policies listed in the CoE Student Guide The Center for Student Conduct is set up to support you when you have been affected by actions that may violate these community rules.  This includes an organized and transparent process, student participation in the process, mechanisms for appeals, and other mechanisms to protect fairness.   Academic Honesty You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material, but all written work as well as responses to in-class questions should be your own.  There are ways to make your work personal and unique even when it seems that there is only one way to correctly answer a question, and the instructors will support you in learning these methods.   This course has a “zero-tolerance” policy concerning cheating and plagiarism.  Students are referred to the University of California, Berkeley Student Code of Conduct for complete details on expectations.  Special attention should be given to Section V and Appendix II. Cheating and plagiarism will be dealt with according to established campus policy.  Students caught cheating will receive a failing grade and a report to the Center for Student Conduct will be filed. The following is a partial list of common cheating/plagiarism situations to avoid: 1. Attempts to “doctor” or manipulate assignments after grading to enhance scores will be considered academic dishonesty and dealt with as described above. 2. Submitting the same work as another student in MAT SCI 45L. 3. Partial or full replication of lab reports from students that have previously taken the course.       • Homework sets that contain similar solutions that fall outside of these guidelines will lead to additional scrutiny and may be considered academic dishonesty. You may not use solutions to questions that are available from websites, various student organizations that maintain databases UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA        Mat Sci 45 - Properties of Materials Department of Materials Science & Engineering           Spring 2021  from previous years, or those provided to you by your friends. If you do this you are engaging in plagiarism.  • Re-grading. Attempts to “doctor” or manipulate answers after grading to enhance scores will be considered academic dishonesty and dealt with as described above."

Final on May 11, 7-10pm (the exam group 8). Enrollment Questions. During the \frst week of classes you should register with your GSI, otherwise your place in the section will be cancelled. Grading Policy. The grade for the course will be computed according to the following formula: 5% for turning in homework + 20% for 12 quizzes (held in discussion sessions on Mondays) based rather closely on the h/w problem sets (with two worst quizzes being dropped) + 25% for each of the two midterms and for the \fnal exam. Sections vary by the number and by the quality of students. If some sections will have better average grades for quizzes this should not be surprising. The grading policy will be uniform. Incompletes. O\u000ecial University policy states that an incomplete can be given only for valid medical excuses with a doctor's certi\fcate and only if, at the point the grade is given, the student has a passing grade (a C or better). If you are behind in the course, an incomplete is not an option! Textbook. The o\u000ecial textbook is Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcenden- tals by James Stewart, 8th edition, Cengage Learning Custom Publishing. Alternative textbooks: Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals 7E for UC Berkeley by James Stewart. 7th edition, Cengage Learning Custom Publishing. Or same thing, 6th edition. The di\u000berence between these editions is minimal. Mostly it is in the enumeration of pages and in the price. If you choose an edition which di\u000bers from the o\u000ecial one, or any other textbook, make sure you have correct set of homework problems. You are requested to do the assigned reading before each lecture. Note that mathematical texts are not meant to be read like novels: very often you will come across passages that must be read many times before they make sense to you. Homework Assignments. Never fall behind in this course, either in the reading assignments or in the homework assignments. Problem sets get rather heavy at times. This is intentional. Sometimes there is simply no substitute for repetitive drills. Problem (and reading) assignments are subject to change. It is normal when a student is trying to solve at home some extra, more compli- cated, problems from the textbook which were not assigned for homework. Problem sets will be collected on Mondays through the Gradescope. It is very e\u000bective when you do a part of your homework together with your fellow students in a discussion group. I encourage this, but you must write your solutions on your own . The homework is assigned for 8th edition of Stewart. 1 2 When you will be working on practice problems for exams, I recommend to time yourself, allowing only 10 min per problem.

Tentative Topics of the Course 11 1.Instructor and General Information \u000fInstructor: Professor Zvezdelina Stankova (Zvezda) \u000fTentative o\u000ece hours (to be \fnalized by the end of the \frst two weeks of classes): \u000fMWF 10:30am-11:30am, MW 2:10pm-3:00pm, F 2:10-2:30pm . \u000fThere are no individual appointments. \u000fQuestions will be answered on a \frst-come-\frst-serve basis. \u000fAdministrative questions will take priority during the last 10 minutes of each o\u000ece hours. \u000fIf you have an urgent question, you must make time to come in o\u000ece hours. The common excuse: \\I couldn't make it to your o\u000ece hours because of reason X, and hence I am writing to you an email.\" will notbe accepted. If your issue is important, you will make time to come to o\u000ece hours. Anything that can be resolved in o\u000ece hours must be resolved in o\u000ece hours; noton email! \u000fEmail: stankova@math.berkeley.edu; ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES! \u000f(occasionally) http://www.math.berkeley.edu/ \u0018stankova 2.Online Platforms Used for MATH 53 (1) Zoom: live lectures, sections, polls, and OHs. Zoom links: on bCourses. (2) bCourses: HW assignments, course materials, and administrative announcements. bCourses is used only by instructor and GSIs to run the course, NOT by students for communications. (3) Gradescope: quizzes, HWs, and written parts of exams. (4) WebWork (in bCourses): T/F+M/C parts of exams; alternative lecture attendance checks. (5) piazza: mathematical discussion. 1 3.Enrollment, Section Switching, bCourse Access 3.1.For enrollment questions, contact: \u000fJennifer Sixt : at enrollment@math.berkeley.edu or by booking a Google Hangouts appt with her through jenucbmath.youcanbook.me/ (1) Use e-mail only for quick advising questions. \u000fThomas Brown: Last Name \\A-L\" students, thomasbrown@berkeley.edu. \u000fMarsha Snow: Last Name \\M-Z\" students, snow@math.berkeley.edu. (2) For in-depth advising, make an appt M-F 10AM{12Noon & 1{4PM via Google Hangouts: \u000fCurrent UCB students: schedule an appt via Cal Central's \\My Academics\" tab. \u000fPospective UCB students: email directly your adviser above (by your last name). 3.2.To switch discussion sections, students must go to CalCentral at (1) https://calcentral.berkeley.edu \u000fThe switch will be possible only if there is room in the section. (2)No access to enrollment: Donotask the instructor or GSIs to switch you to another section or to enroll you in the class. We have no control over enrollment in the class/sections. 3.3.bCourse Access: is granted only to o\u000ecially registered students in the class. Students on the wait list willnotbe added to the bCourse site. Until registered, you need to: \u000fAsk a classmate to share with you any other materials on bCourses. \u000fThe GSIs and I will NOT be sharing course materials with individual students who are not o\u000ecially registered for the class, join late, miss part of the class, lose materials, etc. Follow these instructions precisely, and keep emails to me and the GSIs only for real emergencies. 4.Prerequisites 4.1.Required: MATH 1B Calculus II, or MATH 10A Method in Mathematics, or equivalent. 5.Attendance: Lectures and Discussion Sections 5.1.Enrollment in sections: Each student must sign up for a discussion section on Tue/Thur. 5.2.Attendance Checks: Lectures and discussion sections are mandatory and must be attended synchronously by all students. (1) Lecture and section attendance will be taken in class, synchronously, via polls. (2) Students with severe time di\u000berences will be identi\fed before the semester starts and di- rected to alternative lecture attendance quiz on WebWork btw 10-10:15pm that day. (3) Sections must be attended synchronously by all students and no alternative section atten- dance check will be possible. Thus, sign up for a section that you can attend synchronously. 6.Textbooks 6.1.Required: \\Calculus, Early Transcendentals,\" by Stewart, special UCB edition (ACP MATH 53 STEWART CALC ET), ISBN: 9781305756458. 6.2.Recommended: \\A Decade of the Berkeley Math Circle,\" vol. I-II, edited by Stankova and Rike, MSRI/AMS, for learning proofs and problem-solving techniques. 7.Homework 7.1.Assigned/Due: HW will be posted on bCourses every week, usually right before or after each lecture. HWs must be submitted to Gradescope by 11:59PM the following Monday. HW Solutions are posted 12:01am on Tuesdays, and the quizzes are usually on Tuesdays. Thus, NO late HW will be accepted, as the solutions will be posted for everyone to see at the deadline. No exceptions. 2 7.2.If missed class: If you miss lecture or discussion section: do NOT e-mail instructor or GSI to ask for missed handouts and announcements. Instead, check bCourses and ask your classmates. 7.3.Homework solutions: \u000fPosted onbCourses at 12:01am on Tuesdays. Do not ask for solutions to be posted earlier: you must attempt to do your homework without help from posted solutions. \u000fTaken down the web in a week or so after being posted; hence make sure that you download them and read them on time. No HW solution \fles will be sent to students at any time: please, donotrequest them; ask instead your classmates for any missed HW solution \fles. 8.Reading Assignments It is the students' responsibility to read carefully and thoroughly the assigned textbook section(s) and review their class notes after each class. If you missed a lecture or a discussion section do not ask the instructor or the GSI for their notes. Ask your classmates for their notes. 9.Quizzes 9.1.Total number of quizzes: There will be about 14 quizzes in the discussion sections, given once a week. Quizzes will start 10 minutes before the end of section and will last for 10 min. + 10min. for pdf creation and submission on Gradescope. 9.2.Number of quiz scores in \fnal grade: Only the top 10 quiz scores will be taken into account when determining a student's \fnal grade. No more quizzes will be dropped, for any reason. 9.3.No make-up quizzes: If you miss the time when your quiz is given, you cannot retake the quiz at another time or in another section, and your quiz score will be 0. Thus, when you miss to take your quiz (for whatever reasons, including being sick, having a family emergency, etc.), keep in mind that exactly the top ten quiz scores will be counted, regardless of your reasons. No exceptions will be made to this policy: please, do not send me or to your GSI notes to be excused from quizzes. The quizzes will be based on the current or previous HW and class/section problems. 9.4.Purpose of the \\Top 10 quizzes\": Keep the few times when you might miss quizzes only for true emergencies. The quizzes to be dropped are not intended as a back-up for slacking o\u000b, lagging behind the material, or catching up due to unsatisfactory academic performance on previous quizzes. The quizzes that will be dropped are meant to help you in case of an emergency. No further quiz scores will be dropped. 9.5.Joining the course late and quizzes: Again, 10 quiz scores will be used towards the \fnal grade, including some possible 0s if fewer than 10 quizzes have been taken. 9.6.Content of Quizzes: Ordinarily, each quiz will be graded out of 12 points and will consist of one problem for 10 points and 2 True/False or Multiple Choice questions. Each T/F and M/C question will be graded as follows: 1 point for correct answer, 0 for incorrect or blank. The T/F and M/C questions on the quizzes are intended to prepare you for a problem with many T/F and M/C questions on each exam. One of the T/F or M/C questions on each quiz may be on administrative matters re\rected in the syllabus or discussed in lecture or in section. Thus, you must read the syllabus and be updated on any administrative announcements and in-class discussions. 9.7.Cheat Sheet on Quizzes: One page (one side of a regular sheet of paper), hand-written by the students. No copying and pasting of typed text from anywhere, unless the student has a registered disability that allows for typed or other specially prepared texts. 3 10.Exams 10.1. Times of the three exams: (a)Midterm 1: Fri, Feb 26. \u000fWritten Part: 12:10-1pm (Lec 1), 1:10-2pm (Lec 2); 10:10-11pm (\\overseas\" students). \u000fWebWork T/F+M/C part for everyone: \u001915 minutes starting between 6pm-9pm. (b)Midterm 2: Fri, April 2. \u000fWritten Part: 12:10-1pm (Lec 1), 1:10-2pm (Lec 2); 10:10-11pm (\\overseas\" students). \u000fWebWork T/F+M/C part for everyone: \u001915 minutes starting between 6pm-9pm. (c)Final exam: \u000fWed, May 12th, 3-6pm (Lec 1). \u000fTue, May 11th, 8-11am (Lec 2). \u000f\\Overseas\" students will be distributed among the two regular exams above. Alternative version for the \fnal exam (if at all): Tue, May 11, around 9PM-12midnight. 10.2. No make-up midterms or \fnal exams: Every student must take the midterms and the nal exam on the dates and times above. The alternative \\overseas\" time per exam will be o\u000bered to students who are identi\fed (through a google form) by the instructor prior to the start of classes. 10.3. Scheduling or avoiding con\ricts with exams? \u000fDonotbuy tickets to travel and do notschedule other events during the days of exams: you must take the exams at the announced times. \u000fDonotask for di\u000berent dates or times for the \fnal exam due to \right reservations or other reasons: the \fnal exams times are assigned campus-wide and there will be no personal exceptions. \u000fDonottake this class if you have a con\rict with any of this exam schedule. The MATH 53 must be taken synchronously; which in particular means that you CANNOT sign up for another class during the same time. 10.4. Exam Content. A substantial part of the exams will be based on versions of problems from: \u000fHomework: problems, both regular and bonus. \u000fClass: problems, theory, and ideas discussed in class. \u000fQuizzes: quiz problems from random sections. 10.5. Are the exams comprehensive? \u000fMidterms: The topics for each midterm exam will be based on the portion of the course between exams. Thus, formally, midterms are notcomprehensive. Yet, you cannot forget previous material since parts of it may come up in the solutions to midterm problems. \u000fThe \fnal exam is comprehensive: Anything covered in the course is fair game. 10.6. Cheat Sheet on Exams: One page (one side of a regular sheet of paper) for midterms and two pages (two sides of a regular sheet of paper) for the \fnal exam, hand-written by the students. No copying and pasting of typed text from anywhere, unless the student has a registered disability that allows for typed or other specially prepared texts. All cheat sheets must be submitted PRIOR to each exam on Gradescope for a certain number of points towards the exam (including an empty cheat sheet with the student's name, signature, and date on top), or -5 pts if nothing is submitted, or if the cheat sheet does not conform to the speci\fcations. In case of a suspected actual cheating on exams, a reference to a non-submitted cheat sheet or cheat sheet does not conform to the speci\fcations will NOT be accepted. 4 11.Final Grade Components 11.1. Grading scheme. Grades will be computed by taking: (1) 3% homework. There will be \u001938 HWs, each out of 10 points, checked for completeness. No HWs will be dropped. Each HW will be worth 0 :08% = 0 :0008 of your \fnal grade. (2) 12% quizzes (using only the top 10 quiz scores). At the instructor's discretion, quiz medians of all sections in the class will be uniformized at the end of the semester. (3) 12% lecture attendance. There will be 2 polls in lecture or alternative late evening quiz for \\overseas\" and DSP students with lecture accommodations. Each poll is out of 2 pts: \u000fanswer the two polls any way during the given time: 1 pt; \u000fanswer at least one poll correctly: 1 pt. The top 30 (out of \u001938) lecture attendances will count towards the \fnal grade. (4) 8% discussion attendance. There will be 2 polls in discussion sections (no alternative options for section polls). Each poll is out of 2 pts: \u000fanswer the two polls any way during the given time: 1 pt; \u000fanswer at least one poll correctly: 1 pt. The top 20 (out of \u001928) section attendances will count towards the \fnal grade. (5) 20% midterm 1. (6) 20% midterm 2. (7) 25% \fnal exam. 11.2. Resurrection \fnal. The \fnal exam will resurrect one of the midterms if the midterm has a score lower than the \fnal exam. \u000fThis means that the \fnal exam may count as 45% instead of 25%. \u000fIt is up to the instructor to decide if some of three exams will be rescaled in the end to the same median, so as to give them comparable weights in the \fnal grade. 11.3. Class curve. The \fnal letter grades will be based on a curve, which is not known ahead of time and will be determined AFTER the \fnal exam. Scores so-far will be sent out around mid- semester and Review week (RRR) before the \fnal exam. Class statistics on the midterms and the nal exam will be posted on bCourses. 11.4. Missing both midterms: will result in automatic failure of the course. No option of an incomplete grade here, as missing both midterms will not qualify a student for an incomplete grade. 11.5. Missing the \fnal exam: will result in automatic failure of the course, unless valid reasons are provided for requesting an incomplete grade (see below). 12.Special Accommodations 12.1. Skipping a midterm. You may skip a midterm (but not the \fnal exam!) due to a con\rict with religious creed or with an extra-curricular/sports activity , or a severe medical or family emergency . Skipping both midterms or skipping the \fnal exam will automatically lead to a failing grade. There are no make-up midterms or \fnal exams. \u000fThe student must notify the GSI that he/she will be skipping a midterm and explain the reason, so that the GSI does not worry about what happened. No need for a formal documentation. \u000fThe \fnal exam may resurrect only one missed midterm (but not both midterms). However, this option must be taken only when really necessary. Frivolous skipping a midterm usually leads to poor \fnal exam outcome. \u000fIt is the student's responsibility to learn the missed material due to the absence. 5 12.2. Special Arrangements for Disabled Student Program (DSP) students. \u000fIf you are a student with a disability registered by the DSP on UCB campus and require special arrangements during exams and quizzes, I and the GSI must receive the o\u000ecial DSP accommodation by the DSP o\u000ece at least 14 days (2 weeks) in advance. We will notbe able to accommodate anyone in less than 14 days (as all exams and quizzes will be locked for certain times on Gradescope/Webwork) and the student will have to take the exam (or quiz) along with everyone else under the regular conditions provided for the class. The earlier we are informed about your DSP status, the easier it is to provide appropriate accommodations for you. \u000fDo NOT ask to be given special accommodations while promising that in the future you will provide a DSP letter. Observe this policy: no exceptions will be made. 13.Drop Deadline The results of the \frst midterm will likely be known after the drop deadline. Do not ask me or the GSIs if I think you are more likely to get, say, B\u0000instead of C+: we will not know. The decision to drop the course or switch between P/NP and letter grade options will be entirely yours and you will have to make it based on your \frst several quizzes and the \frst midterm (if its score is available at that point). 14.Incomplete Grades 14.1. University policies: Please, consult the university policies regarding incomplete grades. 14.2. Reasons for Incomplete: An Incomplete \\I\" grade is rarely given. The only justi\fcations for an I grade are: \u000fdocumented serious medical problem, or \u000fa genuine personal/family emergency. 14.3. Conditions for giving an incomplete. When requesting an incomplete, the student must: \u000fhave a passing grade (C\u0000or above) up to that point in the class. \u000fhave completed at least 2/3 of the course work up to that point (thus, essentially, completed everything but the \fnal exam). \u000fpresent a formal document regarding the nature of emergency or the medical problem. 14.4. Invalid reasons for requesting an incomplete. \u000fFalling behind in this course or a heavy work load in other courses are not acceptable reasons for requesting an incomplete. \u000fIf you miss a midterm (for whatever reasons), you will notqualify for an incomplete, as your grade before the \fnal exam will include a 0 on that midterm, which will not have been \\resurrected\" by the \fnal at the time of requesting the incomplete grade. 15.Academic Integrity The Mathematics Department, and in particular, the instructor and the GSIs in this course, expect that students in mathematics courses will not engage in cheating or plagiarism. \u000fDue to the online format of this course, Speci\fc Honor Code and Exam Instructions for the exams and quizzes for this course will be provided in due time. The following is adapted from the Math Department web page to our course. Read it for general understanding of cheating and honor code and adapt it to the present online circumstances by following the Speci\fc Honor Code and Exam Instructions that will be provided by the instructor. 6 15.1. What does cheating mean? Broadly speaking, cheating means violating the policies of a course or of the university in order to gain an unfair advantage over fellow students. A particular kind of cheating is plagiarism, which means taking credit for someone else's work. Cheating and plagiarism hurt your fellow students in the short term, they hurt the cheater in the long term, and they will not be tolerated. On exams, the most basic type of cheating is copying o\u000b of someone else's paper. Graders easily spot when two exam papers look unusually similar, or have similar (wrong or correct) answers, calculations, ideas, or thought structure, even if written in di\u000berent words or order of words. Even glancing at someone else's paper to check your answer is cheating. If you write the correct answer to a computational problem without any justi\fcation or with a bogus justi\fcation leading to that answer, this raises strong suspicions that you cheated, on top of not receiving any credit anyways due to the lack of correct justi\fcation. 15.2. Electronic devices on exams/quizzes. Electronic devices such as phones, calculators (electronic, mechanical, or any other type), and other devices*are also not allowed on exams/quizzes not even to tell the time. There are too many ways to cheat using software and the Internet. Exams are not intended to test your ability to \fnd the answer by any means necessary. The questions might be too easy for that! Rather, exams/quizzes are supposed to test your understanding of the course material, which you will need in order to use math correctly in subsequent courses and in the real world. 15.3. Expectations on exams, quizzes, and HW. Exams and quiz papers are expected to be your own work. In this class we encourage collaboration on homework, as it will be graded for \\completeness\" only; but you are carrying your personal responsibility to learn how to do the HW problems independently so as to be able to solve similar problems on exams and quizzes by yourself. When allowed, if you use proofs or calculations from textbooks or class notes, you need to cite these sources, even if you have rewritten the material in your own words; otherwise it is plagiarism. 15.4. How to avoid cheating? It is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions to prevent cheating. In exams, you should sit as far away from other students as the room permits, and hold your exam papers in such a way that they are not easily visible to other students. 15.5. What to do in a case of cheating? If you suspect that other students are cheating, you should immediately inform the instructor and/or your GSIs. Students may be cheating in ways that the instructor/GSI has never even heard of (unlikely, but possible). Even if you don't mention any names, the sooner you inform the instructor/GSI what is going on, the sooner they can take measures to put a stop to it. You can further report any cheating at: http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/reporting/academic 15.6. Resolution to cheating. If you are suspected of cheating, the instructor may pursue a variety of actions depending on the particular nature of the incident. If you accept responsibility for academic miscondict, the matter can often be resolved between you and the instructor with possible academic sanctions ranging from losing points on an exam/quiz to failing the class, and a report will be sent to the Mathematics Department and/or Center for Student Conduct. It is not necessary for the instructor to determine whether the student(s) has a passing knowledge of the relevant factual material. It is understood that any student who knowingly aids in cheating is as guilty as the cheating student. In serious incidents, or if you maintain that you are not responsible for academic misconduct, the instructor has the freedom and responsibility to impose any academic sanctions within the course that she deems appropriate, and the case will very likely be forwarded to the Center for Student Conduct. In such a case, more stringent actions (e.g., dismissing the student from the university) can be initiated by the O\u000ece of Student Conduct. 15.7. Conclusion. We hope that the above clari\fcations will help prevent cheating. If you have any questions about the rules or expectations, you should not hesitate to ask the instructor/GSI, or the vice chair for undergraduate a\u000bairs in the Mathematics Department. *Tablets/ipads for writing will be allowed in MATH 53, with certain restrictions. 7 16.Conduct Sanctions and Grade Deductions for Illegal Postings This section concerns what will happen when a student pirates course materials and posts them on-line, including but not limited to coursehero.com, or assists someone else in doing that. Appar- ently, the problem is pervasive, it encourages plagiarism, and in the long-run it hurts everyone by undermining and jeopardizing their learning process. Here are the relevant sections from the University-wide Code of Conduct and this is what UCB Student Conduct Committee will use to apply sanctions to students who have posted course materials on-line or elsewhere without explicit permission from the corresponding instructors: \u000f102.23 Course Materials - Selling, preparing, or distributing for any commercial purpose course lecture notes or video or audio recordings of any course unless authorized by the University in advance and explicitly permitted by the course instructor in writing. The unauthorized sale or commercial distribution of course notes or recordings by a student is a violation of this Code whether or not it was the student or someone else who prepared the notes or recordings. Copying for any commercial purpose handouts, readers or other course ma- terials provided by an instructor as part of a University of California course unless authorized by the University in advance and explicitly permitted by the course instructor or the copyright holder in writing (if the instructor is not the copyright holder). As in other classes on campus, any unauthorized by me postings of any course materials, including but not limited to any handouts, syllabus, bCourse pages, quizzes, discussion worksheets, midterm reviews, exams, presentations, lecture notes, pictures, video, etc., will be: \u000fSubject to a letter grade deduction of the \fnal course grade, left entirely to the instructor's discretion, AND \u000fFormally reported to the University Student Conduct Committee. I had never felt the need to impose such strict rules until I was given the opportunity to see the damage that such mis-conduct causes to all students in classes on campus and elsewhere. In case of doubt, before posting any materials related to the course, ask me or your GSIs. As a rule of thumb, anything that I or the GSIs have prepared for the course, anything on the bCourses site, etc., CANNOT be posted on-line. Be advised that there is a simple way to track down who has posted materials. Finally, no one in the classes can take audio or video, or pictures of the boards or anyone in class, without my explicit permission and without the corresponding DSP accommodation presented to me in advance. Such audio, video, or picture materials are subject to the same rules of non-posting and usage strictly by the corresponding DSP student. 16.1. Piazza Site for MATH 53. The instructor will not moderate piazza. \u000fA couple of GSI will be assigned to loosely monitor the piazza site. Other GSIs may occasionally check but are not obligated nor should be expected to verify or moderate the content of the posts on piazza. \u000fThe piazza site is open only for students enrolled in the course, and the topics discussed are restricted primarily to the math content the course: the piazza site is a math site. However, you CANNOT just ask how to solve a problem without having tried it and describing your attempts and where you are having di\u000eculty. Posting full solutions to a problem is also NOT allowed. Posting ideas, partial calculations, and other math discussion is OK. 8 \u000fYou CANNOT post questions that have been answered in the syllabus, in lectures/sections, or in the announcements: if you miss something, you must \fll in the blanks by watching the lecture recordings, re-reading the syllabus and other course materials and announce- ments on bCourses, and individually asking your classmates, and NOT publicly asking on piazza. Piazza is for math questions and some quick logistics questions that have NOT been answered elsewhere (and you have NOT missed lectures or sections). Piazza is NOT for \\questioning, discussing, or arguing about \" the structure and policies of the class: these are the prerogative of the instructor, are NOT up for discussion, and will be applied equally to everyone. \u000fWhile we will disable the ability for students to post anonymously to instructors, we do not wish that to dissuade you from feeling comfortable asking any honest and relevant question. \u000fAny posting of links or references on how to obtain unauthorized or pirated copies of the textbook or other copyrighted materials directly violates the course syllabus about plagiarism. Posting such content is illegal, and any student who does so faces academic and other sanctions. Students CANNOT post pictures from the textbooks, the HW Solutions, Discussion Worksheets, Exams, etc.: no materials or pictures of these materials from our class can be posted (in whole or in parts) on piazza, on any other media used by the class, on email, or on the internet. If you want to refer to some problem, say, in the textbook, site the section and number of the exercise, and that will be su\u000ecient. 17.Questions 17.1. Whom to Ask? Please, refer to the following list for who to contact when you have questions regarding the course. Contacting the wrong people will simply result in redirecting you to the appropriate contact person, and thus, will waste your and our time. GSIs are instructed notto answer any questions outside of their realm of expertise as listed below. #Type of Questions Person to Ask When and How 1enrollment and section placement Jennifer Sixt Thomas Brown, Marsha Snowemail or appointment M-F 10am-12pm, 1-4pm 2quiz and exam scores the student's GSI o\u000ece hours 3missed handouts and announcements bCourses, piazza, classmates anytime 4emergencies, administrative questions not addressed elsewhereprofessor o\u000ece hours 5math questions GSIs, professor sections, o\u000ece hours 6true emergencies that are not caused by you and cannot be resolved in o\u000ece hoursprofessor e-mail, phone 17.2. Email is only for emergencies!

This has been used as an argument for not revising the pedagogy either. The current pandemic, however, has forced a change in teaching medium, and the ​ #BlackLivesMatter ​ movement has made ​ anti-racism pedagogy ​ a broadly accepted goal at UC Berkeley. So this iteration of MATH54 will be a first approximation of what an online MATH54 course might look like when we take as a mandate to implement anti-racist pedagogy - which starts with basic insights from Education Research, such as “Teaching is about students learning”. So we will cover ​ the usual MATH54 topics ​ , but more specific learning objectives will be developed with your help - as part of a ​ Community of Inquiry ​ - and the following structure is a proposal that the teaching team will offer for 4 weeks (based on a proposal of objectives that I’ll present in class). I am asking you to give it a serious try, as it is based on 25 years of experience with guiding engineering and science students in their struggle with differential equations and linear algebra, 4 years of intense anti-racism activism and education, and a deep desire to create an online-space that is as supportive as can be of both your learning and general thriving as human. But I also invite you to step into your power as expert for your own learning capacity and needs - and to join me and the rest of the teaching team (the GSIs and ​ Branden Saenz from the SLC ​ ) in co-creating this space and improving on the first approximation of a 21st century online MATH54 structure in the rest of this document. If this document leaves questions open, see the ​ FAQ ​ , ask on ​ campuswire ​ , during our Tuesday Q&A, or in office hours. (Sorry, email is not a sustainable form of communication with 500 students.) Prof. Katrin PS: In more concrete terms, everything in this syllabus is negotiable - not on an individual basis, but towards a fair and supportive learning environment for all. We will collect ongoing feedback - in person, via forum, or via ​ this form (that can be anonymous) ​ , and also open an intentional dialogue once the semester is under way. If you do not have the wish or bandwidth to contribute to developing this structure, I commit to providing a stable learning environment such that - if you do the work and ask for help - you will succeed with both your learning and grade goals. ACCESSIBILITY and ACCOMMODATIONS We strive to apply the framework of ​ Universal Design for Learning (UDL) ​ , and acknowledge that this is a steep learning curve for our teaching team. So we encourage you to speak up about your needs in each moment as much as possible, as well as give us feedback throughout the semester ​ - in person, via forum, or via ​ this form (that can be anonymous) ​ . To accommodate needs related to COVID-19, disability, family-emergencies, and the many forms of oppression - while our teaching team is ill equipped to judge the ever growing number and complexity of requests - ​ we offer all students 20% “no questions asked” excuses ​ on each type of deliverable by dropping the 20% lowest scores (5 check-ins, 3 discussions, 3 quizzes). ​ This allowance covers all absences for any reason - including adding the course late. ​ If you have used those up (and no earlier than that) ​ ​ and require further accommodations, ​ you can request two more 7.5% excuses (2 check-ins, 1 discussion, 1 quiz) by filling out ​ this form ​ or speaking to your GSI or Prof.Katrin ​ . We cannot offer make-ups after solutions have been discussed publicly, due to considerations of fairness and workload. However, your GSIs are available to provide ungraded feedback on late submissions. If you want to pursue the course despite missing over 35% deliverables, please contact your GSI as soon as this situation is foreseeable. We would need written evidence of your exceptional circumstances (e.g. a doctor's note that explicitly excuses the missed deliverables beyond the initial 20% - listed with dates). In such cases deliverables will usually be made up for by oral exams or using the score of the final exam. The ​ Student Learning Center (SLC) ​ offers highly recommended ​ adjunct courses ​ and drop-in tutoring for this particular course. It also offers general ​ online study and success strategies ​ and ​ individual appointments for students experiencing academic difficulty ​ . The ​ Disabled Students' Program (DSP) ​ also provides access to a variety of services. If you or someone you know is experiencing ​ financial, food, housing or other basic needs challenges - you can find support & services at ​ tinyurl.com/UCB-BNC-C19 ​ . SCHEDULE - calendar, zoom links, office hours, course materials, etc Here is the ​ scaffolding ​ that we will provide to support you in constructing your own understanding of ​ the usual MATH54 topics ​ , along with a suggested schedule of discovery-work, and some ​ deliverables ​ to support your focus ​ 1 ​ . Including dates and topics, this is summarized in the ​ Semester-Calendar of Topics and Deliverables ​ . All times are PST and already include the 10min shifts of BST (Berkeley Standard Time). 1 The need for regular serious deliverables has been one of the main changes suggested by prior students. One reason is that other coursework and life at large are likely to fill up any time vacuum, so these deliverables intend to defend your math learning time - while directly supporting learning. If - after a serious trial - they do not support your learning style, you may propose a plan for alternative deliverables by speaking to your GSI or Prof.Katrin. 2 The suggested quiz time is Thursday 8-8:30am. During that time, answers to technical questions about the quiz will be available on the lecture zoom. Posts on campuswire are not allowed while the quiz is open. Please respect your fellow students’ need for fairness and integrity. Thursday 8:40-9:30am Executive Summary Lecture Take 3*(15-30)min to work on each Block 1-3 of the ​ weekly WorkScript Friday 2h before your GSIs first section [the general due time is forced by gradescope - 3h before your section is safe] Check-In on ​ gradescope Friday sections Group work on Blocks 1-3 Take 3*(15-30)min to work on each Block 4-6 of the WorkScript Monday 2h before your GSIs first section [the general due time is forced by gradescope - 3h before your section is safe] Check-In on ​ gradescope Monday sections Group work on Blocks 4-6 Tuesday 8:10-9:30am Q&A activities Wednesday sections Review Jigsaw for Blocks 1-6. If you have not yet contributed in sections, you may volunteer for discussion and presentation of one of the Block Reviews to satisfy the ​ weekly discussion contribution deliverable. sometime Wed 7pm - Thu 8:40am ​ 2 30min Quiz on ​ gradescope Zoom links Tue/Thu 7:30-10am (office hour and lecture/Q&A): ​ https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/91076888392 Drop-In space ​ : ​ https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/91489341894 ​ (zoom can be used any time; GSI presence will be announced) Recordings Each Fri/Mon, we will share a recording of ​ an instructor walking through their way of filling out the WorkScript ​ . Thu lecture, Tue Q&A: We hope to record but cannot guarantee timely posting due to technical issues outside of our control. Fri/Mon sections: no recording. (The instructor’s WorkScript recording is intended as review material if you miss a section.) Wed sections: may be recorded if live section participants decide to do so. (Otherwise see instructor’s WorkScript recording.) Drop-In and Office Hours To further support your discovery-work, you can use the ​ Collaboration, Tutoring, and Office Hour Drop-In space ​ at any time (except for weekdays 8-10am PST when the zoom setup switches) to collaborate with other students, find tutors, or join office hours. For starters, watch out for an email about scheduling ​ small group meetings with your GSI in the first week ​ . ​ ​ You can score the week 0 discussion contribution point by attending one! Prof.Katrin’s office hours ​ will be before/after lecture times as ​ announced on campuswire ​ , and in the ​ Drop-In space ​ as per (weekly varying) schedule. Course Materials This course aims to support you in ​ writing your own textbook by working through ​ weekly WorkScripts ​ . All scripts, solutions, and other course materials/information will be posted in the ​ public MATH54 folder ​ and/or the campuswire forum ​ . So, unless/until we collectively decide to deviate from the WorkScript model, the ​ Lay-Nagle textbook ​ will not be referred to - for content or exercises. If you would find a traditional text helpful, the ​ Schedule of Topics and Deliverables ​ lists corresponding sections in this book. These may not always match with the content and learning goals as laid out in the WorkScripts, so please only use them as supplementary material. IF we do (collectively decide to go back and) use the Lay-Nagle textbook, your teaching team will make sure that no particular edition is required. The linear algebra parts on our topic list are also covered well in the (free!) ​ Linear Algebra textbook and online resource written by David Cherney, Tom Denton, Rohit Thomas and Andrew Waldron ​ . However, the mathematical sophistication in that book sometimes goes quite a bit beyond what’s realistic for MATH54. Lectures The intention of this scaffolding is to replace the traditional lecture format - which in MATH54, due to the abstraction and density of materials, has rarely done much more than create confusion … layered upon confusion … in 80min blocks. If, however, you would find traditional lectures helpful, you can find a list of suggested lecture recordings in the ​ Schedule of Topics and Deliverables ​ . These may not always match with the content and learning goals as laid out in the WorkScripts, so please only use them as supplementary material. GRADING MATTERS: We commit to providing a stable learning environment such that - if you have the prerequisite skills, do the suggested work, and ask for help as needed - you will succeed with both learning and grade goals. Prerequisites This course builds on a lot of the material from Berkeley's Calculus (1A-1B) sequence. In particular, if you are not comfortable with complex numbers and 2nd order ordinary differential equations (Stewart, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th Edition, Chapters 9 and 17, Appendix H), expect to need extra time and help with ​ WorkScript 1 ​ at the beginning of the course. Complex exponentials will also be used when discussing eigenvalues and ODE systems in Weeks 9 and 10, so they are worth paying special attention to (besides just being cool ;-) … and asking for help if they are new to you! A quick review of series (Chapter 11) is recommended before we discuss Fourier series in Week 11. Deliverables and Proposal for Grade Computations The deliverables are structured to support your learning. ​ 3 ​ Since UC Berkeley requires a letter grade, here is a proposal for determining those from the work that you will hopefully do anyways, “just” to learn. Though we also suspect - given all the other pressures in your life - that grade computations support you in doing the regular work required to learn all this material. This very much is up for collective discussion - just not individual re-negotiation. To give you a stable base, we commit to not making any of the computations less favourable than what is proposed here. Check-Ins: ​ We will have 2 check-ins for each of 13 topics (except for topic 4 due to a holiday), a special 0-th check-in, and a check-out. We propose to count these as 0/1 with no extensions (as the point is to prepare yourself and your GSI for section), but allowing for 20% no-questions-asked excuses (for 5 check-ins), and further 15% excuses (for up to 4 check-ins) via ​ this form ​ . So you would score 100% for completing 22 of the 27 check-ins (or possibly just 18/20 with reasoned excuses). The structure of these Check-Ins has been developed over several iterations of MATH54, and - together with a section structure of group work on uniform problems across all sections - seems to work much better (even in terms of exam scores) than a weekly list of graded homework problems (often copied late at night or while the lecture is talking about the next 3 If - after a serious trial - these deliverables do not support your learning style, we may collectively adjust them. Or if it’s more of an individual need, you may propose a plan for alternative deliverables by speaking to your GSI or Prof.Katrin. subject, and barely graded for completion by overworked GSIs). Online submission makes this an even more effective tool to guide GSIs in preparing for sections. And we are always open to improving this structure further! Discussion Contributions: ​ The purpose of this deliverable is to encourage *everyone* to make constructive contributions to the section discussions. In particular, questions or verbalizing a confusion are immensely constructive. We propose to count this deliverable as 0/1 over the course of each of the 14 weeks. In the 0-th half week, before we get into topic 1, we hope you will complete this deliverable by joining a small group meeting with your GSI (if not in this first week, then at some point soon). In the next weeks (Thu-Wed), we will start counting (on ​ bcourses ​ ) a 1 for one or another of - verbal discussion contributions on Friday or Monday (if that’s inaccessible then writing in realtime - chat or google doc) - facilitating the discussion and presenting one of the Block reviews on Wednesday (when, for each of Block 1-6 of the WorkScript, a small group will compile an executive summary to present to the whole section). Using our general excuse policy, you would score 100% for completing 11 of the 14 discussion contributions (or possibly just 9/10 with reasoned excuses). This, in particular, is a deliverable whose counting we would like to get feedback on: How do we formalize the counting such that we encourage constructive participation in discussion sections, rather than artificial attendance to tick a box? Quizzes: ​ We will have a first survey quiz 0, and one quiz for each of 13 topics with 2 problems for which you’ll get feedback 0/1/2 for “review material from scratch”/”reasonable start”/”essentially complete”. See below for re-takes and late submissions. This makes for 14 scores of 0-4. Following our excuse policy, we propose to count the highest 11 of these 14 quiz scores (or 9/10 with reasoned excuses). Based on proposed learning objectives of conceptual understanding and general problem solving strategies (rather than rogue problem solving by symbol manipulation), the quiz problems will ask for solutions *with explanation*. Our preliminary grading criterion for “good explanation” is that, after erasing specifics of your computations, the explanations and overall structure would empower a fellow student who missed all the reading and work in this Block to do the computations themselves - and understand what’s going on. This, in particular, is a criterion where we will need a feedback loop to see how GSIs interpret the criterion and then adjust it to the ways in which explaining and understanding is working for you in reality. Also, aside from grading criteria: What are the characteristics of a good explanation for you? Quiz-Retakes and late submissions: ​ After the initial grading (usually by Monday night), you can change your submission (or submit a late submission) as often as you need to - until you are convinced that it is correct and well explained. Your GSI will grade it only after the final re-submission deadline (2 weeks after the original deadline). They will only re-grade parts that had 0 or 1 points. The goal is for you to get 2 points - if you do the work. It’s okay to look at the solutions and get help from other humans, office hours, campuswire, etc. It’s not okay to then submit a copy of the solutions or someone else’s work. You should understand the solution - and then submit your own thinking and words. Exams: ​ We see little utility in midterm exams - other than to force engagement with the material, which we believe is better achieved by weekly quizzes with less high stakes. We do have a Final Exam scheduled for Thursday, May 13, 7-10pm PST. We commit to designing this - with your input - not as feedback (whom are we kidding) but so it can be A-ed by “simply” having understood the core principles of 80% of our material. We also commit to allowing any materials that you wrote yourself - for example, by editing and compiling the WorkScripts. This is another area where we particularly hope for feedback once you have seen what your learning outcomes are. How do you imagine this much more conceptual learning to be measured fairly? What preventative measures would you like us to take (or not) to discourage cheating? We do not (yet?!) have good ideas for offering a fair exam at different times - setting different versions is never fair (and an unreasonable amount of work if done well), nor is the cheating potential for the later time. We are open to reasoned proposals for an unsupervised final. But - unless there is a collective decision otherwise - please ensure that you are available for the final exam at the scheduled time. Final Exam UPDATE: ​ ​ We collectively decided to have an essay-style final (see discussion in lecture 4). This will heavily draw on your work with the WorkScripts and - of course - ask for math content. It’s not an english writing test! There will be a sample assignment and grading rubric by spring break (the latest). The actual essay options will be published on April 22, and are due by 10pm PST on May 13. Letter Grades: ​ We propose to compute a total score by 20% Check-Ins, 20% Discussions, 30% Quizzes, 30% Final Exam, that is (assuming no extra excuses, and replacing any quotient >1 by 1) S 2 0 2 0 3 0 0 . 3 i n a l s c o r e ( o n s c a l e o f 0 0 0 ) = · 2 2 # c h e c k − i n s + · 1 1 # d i s c u s s i o n s + · 4 4 s u m o f 1 1 h i g h e s t q u i z s c o r e s + · f − 1 and then determining letter grades as A+ for , A for , A- for , B+ for , B for , B- for , 5 S ≥ 9 5 0 9 > S ≥ 9 0 5 9 > S ≥ 8 5 0 8 > S ≥ 8 0 5 8 > S ≥ 7 5 0 7 > S ≥ 7 C+ for , C for , C- for ,  D for , F for . 0 5 7 > S ≥ 6 5 0 6 > S ≥ 6 0 5 6 > S ≥ 5 5 0 5 > S ≥ 4 0 4 > S Implications are, for example, that you can pass this class by doing regular check-ins, contributing to discussions, filling out the entry survey quiz 0 (for 4 points), and finding a reasonable start for each quiz problem in 9 of 13 weeks. Or you can skip all the check-ins and discussions and “just” get full scores on quizzes and final exam. You can score a B- by doing all the suggested work in check-ins, discussions, quizzes (replacing lower scores by revisions), no matter your final exam. We suspect that if you do all that work, you’ll also do quite well on the final exam, but if you don’t want to take it you could be done after week 11. And to score an A- you would, for example, need this complete work and a score of 50 on the final exam. Incomplete grades These can, according to ​ university policy ​ , only be given if you have \"completed and passed a majority of the work required\" (that is more than half of the deliverables) before unanticipated events beyond your control make it impossible for you to complete the course. In such cases, contact your GSI or Prof.Katrin as soon as possible after the events, and arrange for written evidence to be sent to us. To make up an incomplete, one ordinarily takes the missed assignments in another Math 54 class, taught by a different instructor, in the subsequent summer or regular semester. Prof.Katrin will be teaching Math 54 again in Fall 2021. For other courses, be advised that grading policies and specific contents may be quite different than in this course. Even with the same policies and contents, this process almost always causes a lot more suffering than one hopes - from grade pressure via the makeup work not counting as units, to underestimating the amount of work, or how much one forgets in a few months. So, while claiming this grade option is relatively simple, our advice is to use it only in extreme circumstances - essentially, when you just have no other choice. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY, PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY, and BACK CHANNELS Please review the campus-wide commitments to ​ Academic Integrity ​ and ​ Principles of Community ​ ; in particular: We affirm the dignity of all individuals and strive to uphold a just community in which discrimination and hate are not tolerated. In fact, instead of focussing on the fine line of “appropriate behavior”, we invite every member of this course community to strive for their actions in all contexts to be genuinely respectful and supportive rather than merely appropriate. We embrace open and equitable access to opportunities for learning and development as our obligation and goal. In fact, we are only too aware of many undue stressors on you, as a student and multifaceted human, in these times at UC Berkeley, and are committed to supporting you with overcoming any unfair obstacles. In order for us to provide support in an equitable manner, we ask you to let us - or ​ another source of support ​ or ​ crisis counseling ​ - know about your distress as soon as possible. In our experience, cheating is almost always caused by unaddressed stress, and expectations to “get away with it” can be conditioned by relatively privileged circumstances. ​ This is why asking for support is part of our grading scheme - via the discussion contributions deliverable. If cases of cheating come to the attention of the teaching team, we will ask the course community to guide our response in the spirit of ​ transformative justice ​ , as the main problem caused by cheating is a potential unfairness in the grade distribution. SLACK, DISCORD AND OTHER BACK CHANNELS Back channels come with both benefits and dangers. Building community away from supervision by the teaching team, and getting advice from each other is great, but back channel gossip can lead to beliefs that clearly contradict the syllabus or mathematical facts - in short “fake news.” So please discuss matters of course policy and contents in the ​ official campuswire forum ​ , or at least check facts there before you believe them. Our teaching team monitors this forum regularly and will strive to clear up or flag any confusions within 12hours. We also urge you to apply the same integrity and principles of community to your communication in back channels as you would in the classroom or official online forum. For equitable access, please make sure that invitations to any back channel that you find helpful are shared with the rest of the class - e.g. as community announcement on campuswire."

Ribet TuTh 12:30{2:00pm, 2050 VLSB Last revised: January 6, 2019 1.Instructor and General Information \u000fInstructor: Professor Ken Ribet \u000fEmail: ribet@berkeley.edu \u000fO\u000ece: 885 Evans Hall \u000fO\u000ece telephone: (510) 642-0648 (no voicemail, sorry) \u000fO\u000ece hours: {Tuesday, 2:30{4PM, Student Learning Center {Thursday, 10{11:30AM, 885 Evans Hall \u000fCourse web pages: {Ribet-maintained Math 55 page {Campus-maintained bCourses Math 55 page {Our class's piazza page {The math department page for this course 2.Textbook Required text: Discrete mathematics by Ken Rosen There should be a (well-priced) special \\Berkeley edition\" of this book at campus book- stores. As I tried to explain on piazza, you may be able to limp along with the seventh edition of the book if you have punctual access to the eighth edition to look up the assigned homework problems. 3.Enrollment and Section Switching The math deparment maintains a web page with relevant enrollment information. Note in particular the email address enrollment@math.berkeley.edu for enrollment requests. The course instructor and the class GSIs have no special enrollment powers. 4.Lectures No devices! In general, laptops, phones, or other electronic equipment must be put away during lectures and discussion sections. Students with special needs who can bene\ft from electronic note-taking may use their devices in class after consultation with the instructor (for lectures) or the GSI (for discussion sections). Students using devices are asked to sit at the front of the room whenever possible. The themes and section numbers for each lecture are listed on the class web page. To get the most out of each lecture, it is best to read the relevant sections of the textbook before the lecture. If miss a lecture, ask your classmates for notes from the session that you missed. During lectures, I will use the chalkboards, some slides that were prepared ahead of time, and the document camera. After each lecture, I will post the slides that were projected as well as scans of the pages that were projected from the document camera. A peer evaluation from my Math 10 class last year had this to say about my use of slides: 1 . . . never reads/repeats slide text, but truly complements and expands on it. There is a unique value in coming to Ribet's class, to get his explanation that cannot be found anywhere else. As I lecture, I pause often to invite questions: \\What are your questions.\" You can stop meany time during a lecture|there's no need to wait for my invitation. I tend to speak fast; asking questions gives your classmates a moment to catch their breath and often clari\fes issues that were on other people's minds. Don't be shy about speaking up in class! 5.Discussion Sections 5.1.Enrollment: Each student must sign up for a speci\fc discussion section in order to be enrolled in Math 55. 5.2.Attendance: Discussion sections and lectures are mandatory. 6.Office hours Come to o\u000ece hours! I very much want to meet everyone in the course. My o\u000ece is fairly small, but we may be able to move to a seminar room if a crowd gathers. For Tuesday o\u000ece hours, the SLC is e\u000bectively in\fnite. 7.Piazza Questions of any kind about the course or a homework problem can be posted on pi- azza. \\Dumb questions\" are highly encouraged! Odds are that you'll get a useful answer very quickly from the instructor, a GSI or another student. The advantage of piazza is that everyone gets to see the answers to the questions. Please try to refrain from posting anonymously: Math 55 is a community, and it'll be good for us to get to know one another. 8.Homework Homework will be due on Wednesdays. Assignments will be posted on the class web page. There will be fourteen assignments, each worth Xpoints (probably X= 10). Your total homework score will be the sum of your 12 highest scores, plus one-half of your next-to-lowest score. Your lowest score will be dropped. 9.Quizzes There will be roughly 10 quizzes during the semester. Quizzes are given in section. The dates of the quizzes will be announced well in advance. (I will consult with the GSIs at the beginning of the semester.) 10.Examinations \u000fFirst midterm exam, Thursday, February 21, 2019, in class \u000fLast midterm exam, Thursday, April 4, 2019, in class \u000fFinal examination, Thursday, May 16, 2019, 3{6PM Please do not plan travel on the dates of these exams. If you believe that you have a con\ricting obligation because of an intercollegiate sport or other extracurricular activity, please read these guidelines immediately. 2 Remarks concerning the exams: \u000fI consider it to be a great importance that exam solutions be written up in complete English sentences . \\Solutions\" that include shortcut symbols or consist of strings of equations are likely to receive little or no credit. We cannot guess what was in your mind when you wrote you solutions. Your exam paper represents you to the grader; you are not present to explain what you intended. \u000fThere will be no make-up exams. Exams will be given only on the dates and at the times that are listed. \u000fIf you have a con\rict with one of the exams, you might consider taking the course over the summer or next year. \u000fThe exam questions will be drawn from topics in the lectures, questions treated in the textbook, homework problems, and quiz problems. \u000fI have taught the course several times before! You will \fnd my exams from spring, 2013, spring, 2015 and earlier semesters on the class web page. \u000fThe \frst midterm covers the \frst third of the course. The second midterm focuses on the second third of the course but might incidentally call on material that was discussed at the beginning of the semester. The \fnal exam is comprehensive. (It covers the whole course.) \u000fIf you get a low grade (0, for example) on one of the two midterms, all is not lost! See below for a discussion of the algorithm that will be used to compute \fnal grades. \u000fHowever, missing a midterm without a very good reason is most de\fnitely notrec- ommended! 11.Grading Course grades will be based on a numerical score that is intended to weight the course components roughly as follows: midterm exams 17% each, homework and quizzes 20%, \fnal exam 46%. Incomplete grades will be assigned only to students for whom a documented medical, personal or family emergency precludes completion of the course. Students receiving such grades are required to have been doing work of passing quality up to the moment of the emergency. Here's a description of the computations that we'll do after the \fnal exam has been graded. After appropriate multipliers have been applied to scores, each student will have: \u000fa \frst midterm grade M1between 0 and 17, \u000fa second midterm grade M2between 0 and 17, \u000fa \fnal exam grade Fbetween 0 and 46, \u000fa GSI-generated grade Gbetween 0 and 20 that pertains to quizzes and homework. The sum of these four grades is the composite score C=M1+M2+F+G: Thus 0\u0014C\u0014100; and a \\perfect\" student will have a composite score of 100. Most of us are not perfect. Also, many students walk out of a midterm exam with the sense that they did not perform at their best. Accordingly, we will compute the two variant 3 scores C0=80 63(M2+F) +G; C00=80 63(M1+F) +G: If you fell asleep during the \frst midterm but had perfect scores on the other components of the class, then your C0will be 100. Similarly for the second midterm and C00. Each student's numerical course grade will be the maximum ofC,C0andC00. Your \fnal letter grade will be derived entirely from max fC;C0;C00g|high numbers get better letter grades. The letter grade distribution for this course has historically been: 31% A, 34% B, 24%C, 11% D/F. I will aim for a similar distribution of grades in this course; the numerical course grades will be curved. However, experience suggests that the Ds and Fs in Math 55 go to students who \\gave up\" on the course toward the end of the semester, quite often because of a single low midterm exam grade. To the extent that the \\max f\u0001\u0001\u0001g \" scheme reduces the number of students who jump ship, the number of Ds and Fs will be reduced and there will be correspondingly more As,Bs and Cs. 12.DSP If you expect that a disability specialist will issue a letter mandating special accommo- dations for you, please tell me and your GSI about the accommodations that you expect to be granted as soon as you are aware that a letter will be forthcoming. The earlier we are informed about your DSP status, the easier it will be for us to arrange appropriate accommodations for you. 13.Academic Integrity The Mathematics Department, and in particular, the instructor and the GSIs in this course, expect that students in mathematics courses will not engage in cheating or plagiarism. The following is text is taken from the Mathematics Department web site: 13.1. What does cheating mean? Broadly speaking, cheating means violating the policies of a course or of the university in order to gain an unfair advantage over fellow students. A particular kind of cheating is plagiarism, which means taking credit for someone else's work. Cheating and plagiarism hurt your fellow students in the short term, they hurt the cheater in the long term, and they will not be tolerated. On exams, the most basic type of cheating is copying o\u000b of someone else's paper. Graders easily spot when two exam papers look unusually similar, or have similar (wrong or correct) answers, calculations, ideas, or thought structure, even if written in di\u000berent words or order of words. Even glancing at someone else's paper to check your answer is cheating. If you write the correct answer to a computational problem without any justi\fcation or with a bogus justi\fcation leading to that answer, this raises strong suspicions that you cheated, on top of not receiving any credit anyways due to the lack of correct justi\fcation. 13.2. Electronic devices on exams/quizzes. Electronic devices such as phones, ipads, calculators (electronic, mechanical, or any other type), and other devices, are also not allowed on exams/quizzes (unless explicitly allowed by the instructor), not even to tell the time. There are too many ways to cheat using software and the Internet. Exams are not intended to test your ability to \fnd the answer by any means necessary. The questions might be too easy for that! Rather, exams/quizzes are supposed to test your understanding of the course 4 material, which you will need in order to use math correctly in subsequent courses and in the real world. 13.3. Expectations on exams, quizzes, and HW. Exams and quiz papers are expected to be your own work. In this class we encourage collaboration on homework, but it is your job to learn to do HW problems independently so as to be able to solve similar problems on exams and quizzes. When allowed, if you use proofs or calculations from textbooks or class notes, you need to cite these sources, even if you have rewritten the material in your own words; otherwise it is plagiarism. 13.4. How to avoid cheating? It is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions to prevent cheating. In exams, you should sit as far away from other students as the room permits, and hold your exam papers in such a way that they are not easily visible to other students. 13.5. What to do in a case of cheating? If you suspect that other students are cheating, you should immediately inform the instructor and/or your GSIs. Students may be cheating in ways that the instructor/GSI has never even heard of (unlikely, but possible). Even if you don't mention any names, the sooner you inform the instructor/GSI what is going on, the sooner they can take measures to put a stop to it. You can further report a cheating at: http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/reporting/academic . 13.6. Resolution to cheating. If you are suspected of cheating, the instructor may pursue a variety of actions depending on the particular nature of the incident. If you accept re- sponsibility for academic miscondict, the matter can often be resolved between you and the instructor with possible academic sanctions ranging from losing points on an exam/quiz to failing the class, and a report will be sent to the Mathematics Department and/or Center for Student Conduct. It is not necessary for the instructor to determine whether the student(s) has a passing knowledge of the relevant factual material. It is understood that any student who knowingly aids in cheating is as guilty as the cheating student. In serious incidents, or if you maintain that you are not responsible for academic miscon- duct, the instructor has the freedom and responsibility to impose any academic sanctions within the course that she deems appropriate, and the case will very likely be forwarded to the Center for Student Conduct. In such a case, more stringent actions (e.g., dismissing the student from the university) can be initiated by the O\u000ece of Student Conduct. 13.7. Conclusion. We hope that the above clari\fcations will help prevent cheating. If you have any questions about the rules or expectations, you should not hesitate to ask the instructor/GSI, or the vice chair for undergraduate a\u000bairs in the Mathematics Department. 14.Disrupted Examinations The following has been adapted from the Mathematics Department advising materials to faculty. 14.1. State law during \fre alarms. Over the years, several \fnal examinations have been disrupted by false \fre alarms. State law requires that buildings must be evacuated during alarms, and the police department suggests that classes do so in an orderly, e\u000ecient fashion so that students can return to work as quickly as possible. 5 14.2. Penalties for false alarms. A false alarm is a misdemeanor, with a penalty of up to $1,000 in \fnes and up to one year in jail. If the alarm results in bodily injury (e.g., someone has a heart attack), a false alarm can be a felony with a penalty up to $5,000 in \fnes and three years in state prison. 14.3. When an alarm does sound during an exam. \u000fIf an alarm is pulled after the exam has been going on for more than 2/3 of the overall allotted time, the exam will be considered complete and the grading scale will be adjusted accordingly at the discretion of the instructor. \u000fIf an alarm has been pulled after the exam has been going on for less than 15 minutes, we will evacuate and the students will leave the exams on their desks. After the alarm has been cleared, the students will proceed back to the classroom and resume the exam. Anyone found carrying his/her exam outside the classroom will not be allowed to continue the exam, and the instructor will be given the freedom to decide how and whether to grade this student's exam. \u000fDuring an evacuation, the instructor and the GSIs will visibly monitor the students to cut down on casual exchanges of exam information. \u000fFor exams that have been going on between 15 minutes and less than 2/3 of the total allotted time, the students will leave their papers in the classroom and evacuate. It will be up to the instructor to decide if there is enough time to resume the exam or to reschedule it. 6"

This class provides you with a broad introduction to electronics, including basic circuit principles, design of simple digital systems, use of microcontrollers, information transmission, and instrumentation. We also introduce some principles and applications of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) —which means connecting sensors and actuators to physical objects to track and control their status remotely, and thereby enable new functions. IoT is of rapidly growing importance in mechanical engineering for many reasons —including the prevalence of sensi ng and internet connectivity in (autonomous) vehicles, increasing factory automation, and the large efficiency gains possible with predictive maintenance of machinery (i.e., using data from measurements to fix machines before they  break). You will learn  this material  through a sequence of guided take- home  labs and an open- ended  final project  in which  you will conceptualize and prototype an Internet of Things application. Learning is also supported through weekly homework  and two midterm assignments. To make it easy to follow the course content during remote learning, the course is organized into modules. If y ou click on ‘Modules’  on the left-hand  side of the bCourses  page,  you will see all the lectures,  lab, and homework  assignments, etc, arranged in a logical order. If you work through these items sequentially while observing the deadlines given, you will be able to stay on track and do well in the class. The modules  are: 1. Course introduction and ESP32 microcontroller  familiarization, 2. Circuit principles and components, 3. Communications  technologies, 4. Electronic devices and logic, 5. Sensors, 6. Actuators and drives, 7. Real-world IoT applications,  and 8. Semiconductor  manufacturing. Below is further detailed information about how the course is organized and run.

You can access them by going to “Modules” in bCourses, and then clicking on the page associated with the specific lecture that you want to view. The recorded lectures will b e posted within 24 hours after the lecture. Lecture sessions will use this Zoom link: https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98973084901?pwd=MkI3eEdYU2laeFZBRktoR0FzNjBKZz09 Passcode:  673385 Discussions These will be held on Zoom, starting the week of January 26, and you can join whichever section you prefer; you do not need  to attend the same  section  every  week.  These will be recorded  and posted to bCourses.  Attendance is not required but is highly  encouraged. • Section 101: Monday  or Wednesday 4 –5 PM Both discussion sessions will use this Zoom link: https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98973084901?pwd=MkI3eEdYU2laeFZBRktoR0FzNjBKZz09 Passcode:  673385 Labs Content There will be eight structured labs, covering the following topics: 1. Familiarization with the ESP32 microcontroller  board 2. Solar cell characterization; current and voltage sensing and logging 3. Linear circuits and learning to use the oscilloscope 4. MQTT: a lightweight protocol for transmitting dat a to and from IoT  devices 5. Signal rectification and radio 6. Pulse -width modulation; analog to digital conversion and vice versa 7. Using inertial  sensors A detailed guide will be provided for each lab, usually during the weekend before you are scheduled to begin the lab. For planning your work location, you will need a WiFi connection for most of the labs, which can be your home WiFi, or a phone hotspot, but unfortunately not “enterprise” networks needing authentication, like AirBears2. If you r un into difficulties finding a suitable WiFi connection, please let us know and we will help you find a solution. Remote working For the time being at least, all labs will be remote since the campus administration has decided to start the semester this way. If things later open up and if we are able to make Hesse access available, we will let you know. Meanwhile, please work in a suitable physically -distanced location, such as at home! Page 4 of 7 Last revised: January 18, 2021   Working individually or in pairs You may work  individually  or in pairs  on the labs (no teams  of more than two though).  If you work  in a pair, please  make sure you follow applicable physical distancing requirements (e.g. working in different locations and us ing instant messaging).  You can change whether  you work  individually  or in a pair from lab to lab, and you may work  in a different pair each week if  you like. We recommend using the ME 100 Piazza site to find a lab partner if you would like to find one. Lab kits You will have received information about receiving your lab kit, the cost of which is partially covered by your ME 100 course materials f ee (the remainder of the cost is covered by a donation that has been made to the Department). This kit has been redesigned to aid remote learning, and also to serve the needs of ME102B and ME103. Please therefore keep the kit safe so that you can use it if/when you take those classes in future semesters.  While  occasional  accidentally broken components  will be replaced free of charge within  reason,  the Department  will not  furnish  a whole  new kit for those later  classes.  Similarly,  if you drop ME 100 this semester,  please keep  the kit safe,  ready  for the semester  when you do complete this course requirement. Resource hub: microkit.berkeley.edu To accompany  the physical  lab kit, we have launched a companion website,  https://microkit.berkeley.edu/ , that includes some getting- started guides for various microcontroller applications. This site supplements and does not replace the lab-specific handouts that you will be using.  You can create an account on the Microkit site and add comments if you think they will be helpful to other students. The site is open to the world to view. Our hope is that over time the number of pages will grow to cover many different applications relev ant to Mechanical Engineering projects. Please send us your suggestions! Oscilloscopes In addition to the kit, we are loaning you a mini oscilloscope for the duration of ME 100. The significant costs of these ’scopes have not been covered from the course materials fees, but from a one -off donation that was made to the Department. Therefore,  we will need you to return the ’scopes to us when you finish or drop ME 100, so that future ME 100 students will be able to enjoy the same resources as you. If we “l ose” scopes, we will not be able to afford to replace them in future years. We will work with you at the end of the semester to organize returns in a mutually convenient way and will accommodate people who are away from Berkeley and may need to return them  at the start of the Spring semester. Lab sections/timing/assistance There are six remote lab sections, scheduled at the following times: • Lab 201: M 5–8 PM  (Dr Anwar) • Lab 202: Tu 2 –5 PM (Kevin ) • Lab 203: W 5–8 PM  (Dr Anwar) • Lab 204:  Th 2–5 PM (Kevin ) Since  labs are remote,  you are of course free to do the labs at any time you like before the signoff  deadline  (though they will be much  more enjoyable if you start early  and do them  gradually!)  However,  Kevin  and Dr Anwar  have committed  to be online during the scheduled times above  to answer questions as they come up. You can avail yourself of any of these section times, regardless of the section you are officially signed up for. Virtual queuing for help will be handled via the following website: https://me100.not.cs61a.org/  If you have not used OkPy before, you will first be prompted to create an account. Then you enter the topic you need help with, and staff will be in touch when you reach the front of the queue. They will coordinate a means of communication directly with you (e.g. Zoom, instant message, etc). At other times,  you are welcome to see if an instructor  is logged into https://me100. not.cs61a.org/ , or use Piazza  to crowdsource advice, or e- mail the instructors. Page 5 of 7 Last revised: January 18, 2021 Signoff There will be an online  Gradescope “assignment”  for each lab. The primary  means  of checkoff  will be to upload a video to show your lab working as asked for in the lab handout (e.g. LED flashing; logged data appearing on your computer screen, etc). We will also usually ask you to upload your code, and there may be a couple of other fields for you to complete to show your understanding. If anything is unclear to us from your uploads, we will contact you with any clarification questions we have. Each lab is worth 5 points and we expect that everyone will be able to get 5/5 with reasonable effort. We want you to enjoy the labs and not be anxious about getting every last part of the lab to work perfectly,  but we also want  you to persevere within  reason.  So as long as we can see you have  made significant  effort and progress, a score of 5/5 is  possible. If you choose to work  in a pair, you will only need to do one upload per pair per lab and will list the contributions  of each person in Gradescope. We will give the same score to both people in the pair. Homework There will be ten homework , done on Gradescope, and genera lly due on Friday  nights. We will post the homework  at least one week before they are due and aim to provide graded HW within two weeks of the deadline. Midterm assignments There will be two midterms, on Gradescope. Each will be live for 48 hours: • Midterm 1: launched Tuesday March 2, 8am; deadline Thursday March 4,  8am. • Midterm 2: launched Tuesday April 13 , 8am; deadline Thursday April 15 , 8am. Each  midterm will be designed  to take about  two hours,  but you will not be required to complete them in a single sitting,  and you will not be limited  to two hours.  You can update your solutions  at any point  up until the deadline by clicking  the “Resubmit” button in Gradescope, editing your answers, and saving  them. Project The class will include a design project in which you will conceptualize, design,  and implement a prototype of an IoT application. The brief is deliberately open- ended,  but we will give you some ideas via examples in the class and discussion of current IoT trends. The project may be done individually or in pairs. There will be three deliverables, for which more detailed guidance will follow later: • Concept outline –  a few slides explaining the need identified, target users, requirements, and proposed approac h to solving the problem. • Design review –  live oral presentation of progress during lab sections in the week of March 29, with Q&A from instructors and classmates, followed by uploading progress  slides. • Final outcome –  demonstration of the project outcome by uploading a video of the project outcome and slides explaining the design process. Page 6 of 7 Last revised: January 18, 2021   Obtaining additional components The lab kits contain a fairly  wide range  of components,  including  sensors,  a motor,  and a rotary  encoder.  We are trying to establish a protocol for you to receive additional components from the Hesse labs if you establish a need for them during your project. You may also use other components that you already have or can obtain, although we encourage simple and elegant  solutions,  and in principle you could  score  100%  on the project  using  only the components  in the kit. Custom hardware While  the clear  focus  of the project  is the electronics  and the software to control  them,  we know  that some  projects  may involve custom mechanical components, casings, brackets etc to demonstrate function. If you have a means to make such  components,  you are welcome to do so. You may also wish to take advantage of “Makerfleet”,  the 3D printer  farm that Jacobs Institute is making available for prototyping this semester. As a non- Jacobs -affiliated course, ME100 students are limited to the Ultimaker printers; you send in your design, pay only for materials, and pick up the printed components or get them shipped to you: https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/makerspace- access- shelter -in-place/ Credit weighting Credit for the class is apportioned as follows: • Homework  (10 assi gnments, equally weighted):  15% • Lab signoffs (8 labs, equally weighted):  20% • Two midterms, equally weighted:  40% • Project:  25% o Concept and plan: 25% of project  score o Design review presentation and slides: 25% of project  score o Final outcome: 50% of project score There is no final  exam. Reference texts There is no required text, and all notes will be provided in the form of lab handouts, lecture notes, and supplementary materials. If interested, here are some books that I can recommend: The Art of E lectronics by Horowitz and Hill (Cambridge University Press) is a classic: TK7815 .H67 2015 in the Engineering Library. It is far more detailed than needed for this class, but is very practically oriented, and written in an entertaining conversational styl e. http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b20247324~S1 Getting Started in Electronics by Forrest Mims (Lincolnwood) is concise and very accessible: TK7825 .M56 2003 in the Physics Library.  http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b23958581~S1 Academic integrity We will be adhering to the Berkeley Honor Code ( http://asuc.org/honorcode/index.php ). If anyone has any questions about  the responsibilities  they have as part of this Code,  or concerns  about  possible  breaches  of it, please  contact  Prof. Taylor. Late assignments We do ask that you try to complete assignments  by the deadlines.  We will be accommodating  of occasional  slightly  late assignment completion but  may penalize frequent or egregious lateness. Please make sure you communicate with Eitan if for any reason you think you need more time for an assignment.

The problem sets will be posted every Wednesday on class website, and are due the following week on Wednesday at 5pm in the homework box in the LeConte Hallway.  Late homework will be accepted until 5pm Thursday with a 25% penalty. After this, no further homework will be accepted. Note, this very limited “late” homework policy isn’t because we’re trying to teach you responsibility. We already assume that you are responsible adults! Instead, it’s because late homework is really hard on the grader. There will be 120 total points on most problem sets. However the maximum achievable grade will be 100, on each problem set.  Thus, the student could potentially choose to complete a subset of the HW problems or make minor mistakes on some of the questions and still receive a 100%. The lowest homework assignment grade will be removed from the homework average used in grade calculation. READING ASSIGNMENTS Reading assignments will be posted 48 hrs. before most lectures on class website.   QUIZZES Throughout the semester online reading quizzes will be posted with the reading assignments and must be completed 1hr before the lecture. These quizzes will be purposely designed to be very easy (answers should be readily apparent after simply reading the material). Likewise, there will be sporadic “in class” quizzes of similar difficulty.   The average quiz grade will only positively affect a student’s final grade by up to +3%.  EXAMS: There will be night time midterms and one final exam. We will skip class on these days so that you can study •Midterm 1 over Chapters 1-4.5 of KK on 2/20/20 7-9:30pm •Midterm 2 over Chapters 4.6-8 of KK on 4/9/20 7-9:30pm The final exam is all inclusive.

You must attend the D L section s for which you are registered. Prerequisites: • Math 1A (Calculus) is a prerequisite • Math 1B may be taken concurrently Lecture: • Lectures are given in pre -recorded videos on Bcourses. o A quiz with a few simple questions will be given on the lecture videos  on Bcourses. • Lecture sessions wi ll be held live, but we will do active exercises and problems. o Time/Location: o When remote: https://berkeley.zoom.us/my/adrianleezoom o Section 002: Tu/Thurs  8:10AM -9:30AM, 1 Physics North o Section 003: Tu/Thur 11:10AM -12:30PM, 1 Physics North • Reading: Lectures will be a complime nt to the assigned reading, not simply repeat what is covered in the book. • Clickers: We will use clickers in lecture to facilitate interaction. Clickers are required and you will receive credit for participation only, not for correctness. (see details on grading below) Discussion  Sections: • DL sections meet twice a  week for two hours EVERY week. • In your DL sections you will practice problems and discuss concepts in small groups, with the guidance of a GSI, as well as perform labs. • You must bring your workbook to your DL section. Labs: • There will be 7 labs throughout the semester (see the syllabus) performed in your DL section.  While you perform the labs you will complete the lab worksheet found in th e workbook.  You will turn in the lab worksheet  at the end of your lab section. • Lab section will be EVERY week, and on the weeks where there i s no lab you will have a second discussion section. • If you miss a lab for a valid reason (e.g. illness) you must email  your GSI to let them know  the reason for your absence.  To make up a missed lab, you should attend another DL section during that same week , also email ing that GSI ahead of time to let them know  you will be attending their section.  If you are not able to make up a lab in the week that it runs, one  lab setup will  also be available in each lab room  the following week  for makeup s.  You may only make up a lab in the following week once per semester.  After that following week , you will not be able to make up the lab at all . • While remote, labs will be done by using recorded videos of  the lab, and also makeup labs can be done using the videos. • You must complete all the labs.  One uncompleted lab  will result in a reduction of your grade  by 1/3 of a letter grade.  You can’t pass the class with more than one missed lab. Homework: • There will be weekly homework due Fridays at 11 pm . Homework will be a combination of computer -based homework on the Mastering Physics website and traditional turned in homework. The wri tten homework will be turned in electronically on gradescope.  For Mastering Physics, you must purchase a registration card either along with your textbook, or on the Mastering Physics website (www.masteringphysics.com) directly.  You will need to sign up for Mastering Physics with your Cal S ID# and use the Course ID: cheng98815  If your Cal SID # is incorrect you will not receive homework credit. • One of the written HW problems will be picked randomly and graded each week. • No late homework will be accepted. We will drop your lowest two homework scores. • We encourage you to work with and help other students, however the homework you submit must ultimately be your own work. This means that while other students may teach you how to do a problem, you mus t eventually be able to solve the problem on your own and submit your own solution, not one copied from another student. Exams: • There will be two evening midterms  and a comprehensive final.  See the review and exam schedule also linked on Bcourses for times and locations. • You MUST be available to take all exams. Unresolvable conflicts with the exam dates must be discussed with the head GSI immediately. • All exams are closed book—you will be allowed one 3”x5” card (both sides) handwritten (or size 14 font or larger computer)  notes for each MT and three for the final.   You can have an equivalent area on a single sheet of paper (area = 3” x 5” x 2) • Exams will include both conceptual questions similar to the clicker and workbook questions, as well as quantitative problems similar to homework problems. • Exam problems will be graded based on you r solution s, not you r answers . No credit will be given for correct answers without a clear reasoning  and showing your work . • Exam Dates: o Section 2: MT1 Tu 2/22/22 7- 9pm, MT2 Th 3/31/22 7- 9pm, Final Th 5/12/22 7- 10pm, exam group 16 o Section 3: MT1 Th 2/24/22 7- 9pm, MT2 Th 3/31/22 7- 9pm, Final Th 5/12/22 8- 11am exam group 13 Clickers: • Clickers are required  for lecture. Y ou will receive credit for participation only, not for correctness.   You can use iclicker hardware or use a device such as your phone.  There is a charge for using your device  but it is less than for new hardware. • Clicker participation is extra credit: you clicker percentage will replace 2 percentage points of you r total exam weighting only if your clicker percentage is higher than your exam percentage.  We will start using clickers on the second week of lecture, but we will start counting the extra credit in the third week of class. • It is your responsibility to bring a functioning (with working batteries), properly registered iClicker (iclicker.com) to lecture every day . • There  are NO makeups for clicker questions. We will drop the lowest three days of clicker scores. • You must register your clicker with your name and student ID through the iClicker website (www.iclicker.com/support/registeryourclicker/) to receiv e credit .  If yo ur iclicker is incorrect ly registered  you will not receive clicker credit. Course Center: 105 Physics South • All GSI office hours are held in the course center. • The course center is designed to facilitate group work. It will be open during business hours whether or not there are office hours being held, so feel free to come to work individually or in groups any time. Required Course Materials: • Textbook: Giancoli, Physics for Scientists & Engineers ,Volume 1 ( Custom Edition for UC Berkeley )  It is drawn from the 4 th edition of the book, and that edition is fine to use. • Workbook/lab manual : 7A Workbook (bundled with text or available standalone at bookstore  or digital version ) • online homework: Mastering Physics  subscription • clicker: iC licker Classroom Response System Grading: • The grade breakdown is the following: • • Clicker participation will act as extra credit: if you’re clicker percentage is higher than your total exam percentage, your clicker participation will count for 2% of your grade and your exams will count for 73 % of your grade. • We will drop your lowest two homework score s, lowest quiz score, and 3 lowest clicker scores. • Your homework grade with be split 50/50 between mastering physics and written homework. • The Lab  score will have a small portion based on  attendance in lab . • We will follow the department guidelines for grade distribution: roughly 25% A’s, 40% B’s and 35% C’s. D’s and F’s will be given on a case- by-case basis to students displaying especially poor performance. • A grade of “Incomplete” is only given to students w ho have completed work that is at least “C” quality and are unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond their control. • If your performance improves during the semester, then that improvement will be taken into account for your final grade. Accommodations: • The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) is committed to ensuring that all students with disabilities  have equal access to educational opportunities at UC Berkeley. If you need individualized services or accommodations for exams or other aspects of this course; if you have emergency medical information you wish to share with the instructor; or if you need special arrangements, please inform  the professor and the head  GSI immediately. Midterm 1  20% Midterm 2  20% Final Exam  35% Homework  + Lecture quizzes  10% 5% Labs  10% We may need several weeks before the scheduled exams to make appropriate arrangements,  so please  contact  us as soon as possible. Intellectual honesty: • The student body of UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code . “As a member of the  UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” Every student must  adhere  to this code. See https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code .  You must also abide by the Student Code of Conduct , http://sa.berkel ey.edu/code -of- conduct .  Cheating on exams will absolutely not be tolerated. • Reviewing lecture and reading materials,  working practice  problems,  and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, when you submit an answer to Mastering Physics, written homework, or an assignment to your GSI, you are stating that the  answer/solution  is your own work  and not copied from a book,  website,  friend,  or other animate  or inanimate  source.  All exams (including quizzes) are to be independent efforts; collaboration or help from outside sources during the exam is considered cheating  and will be treated very severely, most likely by your failing the entire course and by referral to the Student Judicial Affairs https://conduct.berkeley.edu Sick Policy • Students who are sick, including Covid- 19 isolation/quarantine, should not attend class or D/L section. Class lectures will be recorded throughout the semester and will be available on bCourse.   For D/L sections and exams, students should send a request to  be excused promptly. Links to University Services • In the event of personal issues affecting your academic performance or if you are falling behind, PLEASE talk to me (or Newton) as soon as possible. There are many resources available to help you, so we strongly encourage you to take advantage of them. Also, keep in mind that working with your peers and providing explanations to other students is an excellent way of improving your understanding of the course material. ● Academic Calendar and Student Accommodations - Campus Policies and Guidelines http://teaching.berkeley.edu/academic -calendar -and-student - accommodations -campus -policies -and-guidelines  Should an exam or deadline fall on a cultural or religious holiday, and you wish to seek an accommodation, please email th e Head GSI with your name and discussion/lab number with ample advance notice. ● Disabled Student Services http://dsp.berkeley.edu/  DSP serves currently enrolled UC Berkeley students with documented disabilities seeking undergr aduate and graduate degrees.

Confidential advocates bring a non- judgmental, caring approach to exploring all options, rights, and resources. ● Student Wellness Resources https://wellness.asuc.org/  A part ial directory outlining campus services that may prove useful throughout a student’s time, ranging from direct academic assistance to student health and wellness resources. ● The Basic Needs Center  https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/  provides support with all the essential resources (food, housing, etc.) needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. ● Suggestions or comments about your courses, the department or your instructors can also be submitted anonymously via the Questions and Comments section of the physics departments’ DE&I website:  https://physics.berkeley.edu/about -us/equity- inclusion/faq- on-sexual -harassment/submit -a-question Statement of Commitment to Equity and Inclusion ● All individuals in the Department of Physics have the right to work and learn together in an environment free of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. We seek to establish a classroom culture that nurtures the physics identity and removes barriers to entry to strengthen pathways into the field.  Setting students on a path to envision themselves with a degree in physics and related STEM fields in greater numbers ensures more diverse graduating classes, more diverse graduate programs, and in turn has the pot ential to inspire a new generation of physicists. We strive to ensure these ideals are the core of our culture. ● Exams and assignments in this course are a diagnostic of your current skill levels, which can be improved with practice, and are not a measure o f permanent ability. As a participant in this class, you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected. We encourage you to approach your instructor or Student Services if: ● Your official records do not reflect your correct name a nd/or set of pronouns that you would like us to use. ● Your performance in the class is impacted by your experiences outside the class (e.g., family matters, current events); we would like to help you find resources to cope. See the Links to University Servi ces below). ● Something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable. Some final words of advice: If you are in trouble (behind in homework, doing worse in the course than you would like, etc.) for whatever reason, please let us know. We’l l try to help! Additional help is available through the Student Learning  Center  (Golden Bear  Center),  the Honors  Society,  the Society  of Physics  Students,  and the Physics  Scholars  Program. Inquire in the Physics Department Undergraduate Student Services Office (368 Physics North) for further information. There is quite a lot of material in this course, and not a lot of time to learn it. There are many resources  available  to help you. We strongly encourage  you to take  advantage  of them."

The full PDF version will be uploaded to bCourses, and you can access the online version here: https://nobaproject.com/textbooks/allison -altman-new-textbook Course Description & Goals: Psychology 2 will allow students to sample a collection of past and present topics examined within the vast field of psychology. This class will have an especially strong focus on the psychology related real-world situations and problems that we face in the current day. Areas covered in this class will include biology, development, cognition, social psychology, personality, abnormal psychology, and others. Format: The course will be virtual yet synchronous, meaning that lectures and discussion section materials will not be prerecorded, and will be given in real time through Zoom at the class times (Tuesday/Thursday, 8:00am-9:30am). We will not have GSI’s and sections, and thus you are only required to attend lecture and come to my office hours if you have questions on the material. I will try to record each lecture and post it to bCourses that day, but please do not rely on this, and try to attend each section if you can. Course Requirements: Readings: All assigned readings come from the textbook listed above. All readings will be made available on bCourses as PDFs. All readings are listed on your course schedule below. Please note the lecture that each reading is associate with. Attendance: There will be NO attendance requirements. I expect you to attend virtual lectures, but will not be taking attendance. Exams: There will be three exams in the course. All 3 exams will be: - Synchronous (during class times) - Open note See course schedule, below, for the dates of each exam. You will not be required to log onto Zoom during the exams. The exams will be multiple choice and open book. Although I cannot (and will not) police Page 2 of 4 your behavior, I ask that you work alone and do not work collaboratively on exams . Please respect this request, given the flexibility I have provided. Final Exam: The final exam will be asynchronous, and you will have 24 hours to complete it. Again, the final exam will be multiple choice and open book. Although I cannot (and will not) police your behavior, I ask that you work alone and do not work collaboratively on exams . Please respect this request, given the flexibility I have provided. RPP: You will be required to participate in the Research Participation Program. In order to know how to participate in studies through the Research Participation Program (RPP), please thoroughly read the document, \"RPP Information for Students\", which has been updated for this term. Then, set up a Sona account as instructed. We recommend doing this as soon as possible. If you have any questions, you can contact RPP at rpp@berkeley.edu . Grading: Final grades will be calculated on the basis of 405 points distributed as follows: 3 Exams (100 points each)  300 total possible points 1 Final Exam     100 possible points RPP     5 possible points Total Possible Points   405 Your grade will simply be your total earned points, divided by 405 points. Final grades will be based on a standard 100% scale: A=90%-100%, B=80%-90%, C=70%-80%, D=60%- 70%, with + and – for the upper and lower 3% extremes of those ranges (e.g. B- = 80-82.9%, B = 83- 86.9%, B+ = 87-89.9%). Please note, there is no rounding up in this class, your % is your %. Academic Honesty: Both the University and I take academic honesty very seriously.  Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing on an exam or assignment will automatically fail the class. Their behavior will also be brought to the attention of the psychology department and University. Afterward, further actions might then be taken by both sources. Disability Statement: If you are a student who needs academic accommodations or support because of a documented disability, you should contact me and provide copies of your contract or accommodation letters as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made. All discussions will remain confidential. If you have questions about accessing Disability Support Services, documenting a disability, or requesting accommodations, you should contact the appropriate disability support program at your institution. ***** Course Schedule: The following contains a course schedule for the semester.

The Compassionate Instinct . WW Norton. Free Resources from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center  greatergood.berkel ey.edu  Great articles ggia.berkeley.edd   Science -tested practices Goals and procedures The goal of this course is to engage you in an interdisciplinary approach to the study of happiness.  The first part of the course will be devoted to understanding happiness across history  and the great cultural and ethical traditions (e.g., Buddhism, Age of Enlightenment).  With these perspectives as backdrop, we will consider three sources of happiness  and the scholarship surrounding them .  A first is the cultivation of passions and intuitions  that play a strong role in the good life (e.g., compassion, gratitude, awe, justice) .  A second is social connection, and processes such as cooperation , non- violence, kindness, and forgiveness , which promote strong ties  and communities .  A third is the resilient mind in handling stress , and how it is cultivated by practices such as mindfulness, self -compassion, narrative, and play. By design, this class draws upon the wisdom of psychology (e.g., S ocial Psychology, Health Psychology, Neuroscience) and related disciplines ( Economics, Sociology, History, Anthropology).  While exploring ideas from the past 5000 years,  this class is also rooted in the scientific method and its grounding in theory, precise measurement , experimenta l design, and hypothesis testing.  Given the urgency of the problems we face today (climate change, rising stress,  racism and sexism,  inequality), during this course we will also regularly engage in “happiness practices” that are secular, science- tested br ief practices (the BEARS approach!), that have proven to be beneficial for the individual and the community , and that I hope that you build upon through the course of your life . Grading Grading will be based on t wo exams as well as your participation i n section and RPP . There is a lot of reading in the course – three books as well as a series of peer -review empirical articles in your sections. P lease stay up to date.  The exam s will be based largely on the material covered during lecture  and section , and will involve short IDs and multiple choice questions .

What do organizations do, why do they do them, and what implications do their practices have for society? Sociology has long directly or indirectly focused upon the role that organizations play in society. Classical perspectives such as Marx’s focus on the for-profit organization as a site of capitalist exploitation. Durkheimian perspectives might pay attention to social solidarity within the organization and/or the role that collective representations shared by organizational members play in organizational life. Weber developed the most systematic theory of organizations of the three; he understood the modern, bureaucratic organization as the principal instrument of the rationalization of social action that defines modernity. Subsequently, organizational sociology in the U.S. in the mid 20th century was concerned about explaining the gap between Weber’s depiction of bureaucracy as the embodiment of efficiency and the observed reality of bureaucracies as hopelessly inefficient. This course however will focus on sociological perspectives on organizations developed from the 1970s onward. The ways organizations behave have changed, and so have the ways that sociologists think about how organizations behave. Contemporary organizational sociology tends to reject macro-level “grand” narratives about organizational behavior, but also rejects micro- level approaches such as those offered by symbolic interactionism or even microeconomics. Instead, we will focus on how different parts of the organizational world are shaped by different “local” orders (a meso-level approach). The foundation of the course, which will be laid out in the first weeks and leading up to the first midterm, will be three major, and different, conceptual approaches—the population ecology, the relational, and the institutional perspectives—for understanding what this meso-level order that shapes an organization’s behavior is. Concretely, the course will be built around case studies, each from a different part of the organizational world—public higher education, the fast food industry, the shareholder corporation, agencies in the federal government, and more. The purpose of each case study is to demonstrate the usefulness of contemporary sociological perspectives in illuminating what these organizations do, why, and what implications their practices have for society.

SCHEDULE SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION   CONSULT BCOURSES FOR MOST CURRENT SCHEDULE Page 2 of 5 Grading Your course grade will be determined by:  An organizational theory exercise , aimed at getting us to understand how to think about behavior in organizations familiar to us, but in a specifically sociological way. This exercise will be worth 20% of the course grade.  Two take-home midterm exams , each 30% of the course grade. They will be “short essay” style in nature (further details to be given later).  An in-class final exam , administered during the University’s officially scheduled timeslot for the course (exact time yet to be announced). The final exam will be cumulative and multiple choice. The final exam is worth 20% of the course grade. The course grading scale is as follows: A+ 97+ A 93-96 A- 90-92 B+ 87-89 B 83-86 B- 80-82 C+ 77-79 C 73-76 C- 70-72 D+ 67-69 D 63-66 D- 60-62 F 0-59 When it comes time to compute overall course grades, I will round to the nearest whole number using standard rounding conventions. It doesn’t really matter what the letter grade on the individual assignments are. There are no other discretionary considerations that will factor into your grade. Furthermore, I do not offer extra credit beyond that which I may build in to the midterm and final exams. There are no surprises in how I calculate course grades. The GRADES section on bCourses incorporates the weightings above and will accurately keep you apprised of your course progress. During the semester, with a little arithmetic, you can figure out how you need to do on subsequent exams to earn a particular grade. Recommendation Letters Writing recommendation letters is an aspect of an instructor’s job which I embrace readily. However, it is difficult for me, and unhelpful to all parties involved, to write letters for students I do not know very well. I do have, and have exercised, the discretion to decline to write letters when I don’t know students beyond what grades they’ve earned in the course. If you anticipate asking me to write a letter, it is in your interest to participate in class discussion, visit me during my office hours, etc., and let me know what your plans and interests are above and beyond course material.

Academic Honesty & Classroom Conduct The UC Berkeley Honor Code states that “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others” ( https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor- code). I expect you will follow these principles. You may not copy specific text or ideas from others, whether from fellow students, from authors of our readings or other material you find, without specific attribution. To do otherwise is to plagiarize. You may not cheat on any of the exams by bringing in illicit outside material, copying from fellow students, or engaging in other dishonest practices. Violation of these rules will result in an immediate -0- on the entire assignment in question, plus a report to the Office of Academic Affairs at my discretion. You may of course discuss the lectures and readings with your fellow students. Forming studying groups on your own is encouraged, especially since there are no discussion sections to accompany this course. If these groups are used to struggle through ideas or debate topics (both are also good uses of class time, by the way!), then the effort expended can be very rewarding. However, if groups are used simply to memorize a classmate’s notes by rote, to subsequently recite on exams, this is effectively another form of plagiarism  as far as I am concerned. I use this specific example because it has popped up in my courses before. Study group meetings should be suspended during periods where a take-home exam is active. They can begin again after the exam due date has been reached. Use of laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc. in class.  I use my laptop for virtually everything and do not expect students not to utilize the various digital technologies we have at our disposal today. However, if you are texting, Twittering, Facebooking, watching YouTube or Netflix, or some other such thing in class, you are likely distracting others and I will ask you to leave.

TIME AND LOCATION: The lectures will be recorded live on zoom at the regularly scheduled times (TuTh 2pm-3:30pm PDT). I encourage you to attend live if possible, though you can also view on bcourses.  I will try to post them by 5:30pm.  If I ever get kicked off zoom during live lecture, I will attempt to reconnect. If I give up I will post an announcement on bcourses so you know I’m not coming back. If I am ever gone for more than 15 minutes you can assume that I’m unable to come back. TEXT, RESOURCES:  Required text: Statistics, 4th edition, by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves. I originally listed this as a recommended text but I think the course will work more smoothly if this is required.  OFFICE HOURS: Once we ﬁnalize, I’ll post ofﬁce hours in an announcement on bcourses. For the ﬁrst week of classes, I’ll have ofﬁce hours TuTh 3:30-5pm (right after lecture) and WedThuFri 9-11am. R: We will be working with the software R to enhance and deepen your comprehension of the concepts that you will be studying, and to provide you with tools that you can use for analyzing data.  You will need to download both R  and the environment for R called RStudio. Instructions will be posted on bcourses. When I lecture about R, I recommend that you follow along and run the posted lecture code while you watch lecture. Often it is nice to change the code I’m doing slightly to see what happens.  DISCUSSION FORUM: We will be using Piazza for discussions. If you have a question (that is not of a personal nature, but about the material) please post it to the class piazza site. The GSIs and I will monitor Piazza, but I encourage you to answer each others' questions. That said, I also want you to think about the problem before posting it on Piazza. You don’t want to become too reliant on hints. Please don’t post answers on piazza. We do our best to respond within 24 hours, but if you post in the evening for a HW due at 11pm, you should not expect to get a response. SECTIONS: Sections will not meet on Wednesday January 20 but will meet Monday January 25 and after that. We may change some section times if there is interest (especially for students in very different time zones). Section is optional, mostly will be problem solving sessions. Sections will not be recorded. STAT 20 SPRING 2021  Introduction to  Probability and Statistics \u00002 HOMEWORK:  You will turn in homework assignments that you will need to upload to Gradescope, which is the website that you will use to submit your homework.  The homework will consist of selected problems from the text and some R-programming assignments and will be graded on completion and not on correctness. Generally HW will be due Fridays at 11pm and will be announced a week ahead of time.  For some HW assignments I’ll also assign a short reading or podcast about current events for you to comment on. MINI-QUIZZES There will be a 10 minute mini-quiz after every lecture, due before the start of next lecture.  They will be posted on bcourses and you will have a window between about 5:30pm PDT and the start of the next lecture in which to take the quiz. These will be quick conceptual quizzes that you shouldn’t have trouble with if you view the lectures. I will not take attendance for lectures but you should deﬁnitely watch the lecture if you expect to get full points on these quizzes, sometimes the questions will be just to check to see if you watched and will not have to do with statistical content. QUIZZES AND EXAMS: There will be 30 minute quizzes due almost every Wednesday at 11pm (not the ﬁrst week, midterm week, etc). You will take them online and you’ll  I will drop the two lowest scores when computing your grade. In addition, there will be a 1.5 hour midterm on Thursday/Friday March 4/5. For the quizzes, midterm and ﬁnal you will have a 24 hour window in which to submit, and you must submit within the time limit starting when you ﬁrst open the quiz/exam on Gradescope. So for example for the quizzes, you can take the quiz whenever you want within the window, but you must submit the quiz within half an hour after starting it (I may also give a little extra time to make the submission).  A three hour cumulative ﬁnal exam will be given in a 24 hour window including the scheduled ﬁnal exam time, Monday May 10, 12:30-3:30pm. I’ll announce the exact timing of all of these on bcourses when we get closer. The quizzes will consist of problems like those from the HW, section problems and also R-related material. The exam problems will tend to be a little more in depth, especially integrating material from different parts of the course. You’ll get old exam problems with solutions closer to the exams. DATA ANALYSIS PROJECTS:  You will do three group (4-6 students) projects throughout the semester.  The ﬁrst two will be smaller in scale as practice, and the ﬁnal project will be longer at the end of the semester, using the skills and knowledge you will have developed throughout the semester.  STAT 20 SPRING 2021 \u00003 GRADING:  •Homework sets: 10% (the lowest two will be dropped) •Mini-quizzes: 5% (the lowest 5 will be dropped) •Weekly Quizzes: 10% (the lowest two quiz scores will be dropped) •Two smaller group projects: 5% each for a total of 10%. •Data analysis ﬁnal project: 15% (group project due at end of semester, start after midterm) •Midterm: 15%  •Final: 35% This class is graded on a curve. Your ﬁnal letter grade is calculated based on your percentile in the class (more or less) according to the following grading scheme (mandated by the statistics department): top 30% gets some kind of an A (roughly a third get A+, A, A-, perhaps a bit more stingy with A+), next 40% some kind of B, next 20% some kind of C, and lowest 10% D/F.  Note that especially with the lowest 10% these are guidelines, not certain.  Slightly more or fewer students may get any particular grade. ABOUT THE COURSE & LEARNING GOALS Stat 20 is an introductory course and does not assume prior knowledge of any probability or statistics. We will discuss examples from various ﬁelds, and some mathematical background such as calculus is assumed, mostly to make sure that you have some level of mathematical maturity. You will not be required to use calculus in this course. It is difﬁcult to succeed in today's world without a solid understanding of basic statistics in the ﬁelds of business and economics, or just to be an informed citizen and consumer. This course aims to provide you both with such an understanding and with the statistical tools you will need to analyze data. To this end, we will do some programming in R, which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that runs on a wide variety of platforms. We will be using the open-source IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio.  We hope that by the end of the semester, you will be equipped with the statistical and computational tools you need to draw conclusions about the data you will study. By introducing you to the powerful computational environment R, you will gain a better understanding of the world around us and be able to perform some sophisticated data analysis.   Students at UC Berkeley are often trained (and screened through the admissions process) to be excellent at memorizing formulas and plugging numbers into them. This course is focused on going deeper, and your study habits may beneﬁt from some tweaks. Rather than doing lots and lots of problems, it is better to spend your time doing the problems with some careful thinking.  Even after you get the answer to a problem, spend some time thinking about questions like: “Why is that the right answer?” “Under what circumstances can this method be used, and when is it not appropriate?”  “In what ways is this problem similar and different from other problems I’ve done?” “How do I recognize that this is the right method for this problem?” “If I change the setup of the problem a little, how does that change the answer, and is the method still valid?” Questions like this will help you to understand the material more deeply and excel on quizzes and exams. STAT 20 SPRING 2021 \u00004 COURSE MATERIALS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  Each week you will ﬁnd the assigned material posted on bcourses. Please make sure to check in on Monday morning to see what is coming up that week. This course is built on a Learning Management System (LMS) called Canvas and UC Berkeley’s version is called bCourses. You will need to meet these computer speciﬁcations to participate within this online platform. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:  Please read the university's statement on academic integrity. You will be held to the UC Berkeley Honor Code.  Cheating: Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam will receive a failing grade and will also be reported to the University Ofﬁce of Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, do not communicate with others during the quizzes and exams and do not seek answers online. You are welcome to discuss the homework problems, both from the text and coding problems, with other students, but write them up on your own so that you learn the material. Last fall I ended up failing 11 students for cheating and I really hate to do that. Please don’t cheat. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:  Please see me as soon as possible if you need particular accommodations so that we can work out the necessary arrangements for the quizzes and exams. You are responsible for making sure that we know about your accommodations sufﬁciently in advance to schedule with the DSP proctoring services.
